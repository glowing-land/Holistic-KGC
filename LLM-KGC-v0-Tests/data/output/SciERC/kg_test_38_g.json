    "MBR decoding significantly affects the performance of the MBR decoders, which are designed to minimize the expected loss of translation errors. These decoders report their performance specifically on the Chinese-to-English translation task, showcasing their effectiveness in statistical machine translation (MT). The statistical approach, which encompasses Minimum Bayes-Risk, aims to minimize the expected loss of translation errors through the application of various loss functions. MBR decoding can be utilized to tune both specific loss functions and statistical MT performance, ensuring that the translation process is optimized. Furthermore, the hierarchy of loss functions, which includes word strings, word-to-word alignments, and incorporates various levels of linguistic information, has a broader term that encompasses specific loss functions. This structured approach ultimately contributes to enhancing translation performance by measuring and addressing translation errors.",
    "Word-to-word alignments are derived from the MT system and represent a fundamental aspect of its functionality. In the context of statistical machine translation, the hierarchy of loss functions incorporates syntactic structure, which is essential for understanding the grammatical relationships within sentences. Parse-trees, which illustrate the syntactic structure, are generated from source and target language sentences, providing a visual representation of the grammatical relationships. These parse-trees also specifically pertain to target language sentences, further emphasizing their role in the translation process. Overall, the interplay between these elements highlights the complexity and depth of machine translation systems."
