    "This paper explores the perception of transparent objects from images, focusing on how features that are imaged through a transparent object behave differently from those that are rigidly attached to the scene. It discusses the broader category of objects that includes these features and emphasizes the challenges posed by transparent objects, which can be complex in structure. The paper introduces a novel model-based approach that recovers the shapes and poses of transparent objects, which are also considered shapes and poses in a broader sense. This approach is validated through numerous simulations that verify the practical feasibility of the algorithm. Furthermore, transparent objects are included in real scenes, highlighting their significance in visual perception and analysis.",
    "Transparent objects may be composed of multiple layers, which can have different refractive indices. A single image detects these transparent objects within a scene, although it is often difficult to identify them due to their optical properties. This paper explores the challenges faced by a moving observer in perceiving transparent objects in real scenes. The layers of these objects contribute to their complexity, as they possess varying refractive indices that affect light propagation. Furthermore, features that are rigidly attached to the scene can complicate the detection of transparent objects. The practical feasibility of our algorithm is demonstrated through its ability to recover the shapes of these objects with high accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of the model-based approach in analyzing images."
