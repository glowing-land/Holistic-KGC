    "The proposed approach represents three-dimensional objects in terms of affine-invariant image patches and their spatial relationships. This novel representation combines affine- invariant image patches, spatial relationships, and multi-view constraints without requiring a separate segmentation stage. The proposed approach is applicable to cluttered scenes, allowing for recognition in a single photograph taken from an arbitrary viewpoint. Moreover, the acquisition of true three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models from multiple images allows for matching and reconstruction processes guided by normalized representations of their appearance.",
    "A novel representation has been proposed, which does not require a separate segmentation stage. This approach builds upon preliminary modeling and recognition results, demonstrating its broader applicability."
