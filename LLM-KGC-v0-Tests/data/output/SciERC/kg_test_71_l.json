    "In this study, we investigate the weak equivalence of Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars. A discussion comparing the linguistic expressiveness of these two formalisms reveals that they share similarities but are not identical in all aspects. The authors turn to a broader examination of the relationship between the two grammatical formalisms, which has implications for their linguistic expressiveness."
