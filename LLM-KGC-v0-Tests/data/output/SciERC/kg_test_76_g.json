    "This paper presents a method and a general method for language model adaptation. The method is a specific instance of the general method, which aims to build a model. Additionally, the paper discusses various language model adaptation methods, which also fall under the broader category of methods. Among these, the sentence-by-sentence error correction method is highlighted, which allows for the correction of output sentences and captures the statistical behavior of specific words. The paper proposes to concentrate on the positions where the words in the list appear, utilizing these words as correction units. Furthermore, a variety of methods for preparing a segmented corpus are explored, all of which contribute to the advantages of our method in enhancing speech recognition accuracy. The experiments conducted utilize the method to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches.",
    "The general method is designed to segment a raw corpus, which serves as the foundation for various language model adaptation methods. These methods utilize a word list, which is a collection of words that aids in the adaptation process. However, the implementation of this sentence-by-sentence error correction method can result in a decrease of productivity for annotators, particularly when they encounter grammatically complicated positions. This decrease in productivity is a broader term that relates to overall productivity in the correction process. The statistical behavior of specific words is an important aspect of language models, which are statistical models that predict word sequences and are evaluated based on their speech recognition accuracies. The results of the experiments conducted in this paper showed the advantages of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the performance of language models."
