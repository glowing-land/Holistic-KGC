    "This paper presents an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps for images extracted from modern computer games. Creating large datasets with pixel-level labels requires a significant amount of human effort, which has been extremely costly due to this requirement. The presented approach aims to address this challenge by leveraging recent progress in computer vision, driven by high-capacity models trained on large datasets."
