    "Turkish, an agglutinative language with finite-state but complex morphotactics, uses derivational and inflectional suffixes to form word structures. The description of Turkish word structures was published by Karttunen in 1983, which describes the two-level morphology of Turkish words. This description is based on a root word lexicon of about 23,000 roots words and has been implemented using PC-KIMMO environment. Morphemes convert the word from nominal to verbal structure or vice versa."
