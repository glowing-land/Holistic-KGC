    "Experimental results show that our histogram-based interest point detectors perform particularly well for tasks of matching textured scenes under blur and illumination changes, capturing large-scale structures and distinctive textured patterns with strong invariance to rotation, illumination variation, and blur. Our method can capture these patterns by incorporating histogram- based representations and finding image regions that present a distinct distribution in the neighborhood. Furthermore, an extension of our method is presented for space-time interest point detection in action classification. In contrast, existing interest point detectors measure pixel-wise differences in image intensity. The proposed detectors are able to capture large-scale structures, while our new approach presents a novel method for detecting interest points using histogram information."
