    "This paper evaluates both a hand-crafted template-based generation component and a trainable sentence planner, revealing that the trainable sentence planner performs better than the hand-crafted component. The hand-crafted template-based generation component is a specific instance of a broader category known as the hand-crafted system. Similarly, rule-based sentence planners and two rule-based sentence planners are also considered broader terms for the trainable sentence planner. In the evaluation, the trainable sentence planner outperforms two baseline sentence planners, which themselves fall under the broader category of baseline sentence planners. The quality of utterances produced with trainable components can compete with those generated by hand-crafted template-based or rule-based approaches. Techniques for automatically training modules of a natural language generator have been proposed to enhance the performance of trainable components. Additionally, rule-based sentence planners and two rule-based sentence planners are categorized under rule-based approaches. The hand-crafted template-based generation component and the two rule-based sentence planners are involved in an exhaustive comparison, which assesses their effectiveness in the context of a spoken dialogue system, where the trainable sentence planner is specifically designed to operate.",
    "The quality of utterances is a significant concern for trainable components, which are designed to enhance the effectiveness of natural language generation. A trainable sentence planner has been shown to perform better than traditional rule-based systems, indicating its potential for generating more natural and coherent utterances. In evaluating the performance of the trainable sentence planner, two baseline sentence planners are utilized to conduct an exhaustive comparison, which includes subjective human judgments to assess the quality of the generated outputs. Furthermore, rule-based sentence planners and hand-crafted template-based approaches fall under the broader category of rule-based systems, highlighting the contrast between these traditional methods and the innovative trainable components. The quality of utterances produced with trainable components is also related to the broader concept of quality in natural language generation, as well as the utterances themselves. Techniques for automatically training modules of a natural language generator contribute to the overall effectiveness of the natural language generator, which aims to produce human-like text."
