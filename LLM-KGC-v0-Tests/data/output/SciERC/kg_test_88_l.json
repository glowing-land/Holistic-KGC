    "This paper proposes a novel moderate positive sample mining method to train robust Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for person re-identification, addressing the problem of large variation. The proposed approach learns deep metrics and uses them to select suitable intra-class training samples within a local range, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks. Moreover, this paper presents two strategies that are effective in learning robust deep metrics for person re-identification. From this point of view, it is critical for selecting positive (intra-class) training samples within a local range to train CNN embeddings, especially when dealing with large intra-class variations.",
    "This paper proposes two novel strategies for person re-identification, which significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks. The current deep embedding methods rely heavily on Euclidean distance, but this can be problematic when dealing with large intra-class variations and curved data distributions. To address these challenges, we improve the learning process by constraining metric weights using a novel moderate positive sample mining method. This approach is particularly effective in approximating geodesic distances and improving generalization abilities. Furthermore, our proposed strategies are robust to various environmental factors such as illumination and occlusion.",
    "The concept of Euclidean distance, which measures straight-line distances between points, falls under a broader category known as metric. Similarly, pedestrian data and geodesic distance are also types of metrics used to quantify different aspects. In terms of spatial relationships, local range combines with the graphical relationship between samples to provide insights into connections between data points. Experiments can be seen as a type of study that investigates research questions through controlled tests. State-of-the-art methods in various fields often rely on strategies to achieve specific goals. Finally, camera views and point of view are related concepts that influence how we perceive and evaluate scenes."
