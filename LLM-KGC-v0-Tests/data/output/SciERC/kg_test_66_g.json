    "This paper describes the process of collecting statistics on cooccurrence patterns, which is facilitated by an automatic scheme. The automatic scheme for collecting statistics operates on a large corpus, enabling the analysis of cooccurrence patterns. The results of the experiment show that cooccurrence statistics effectively reflect semantic constraints, which are crucial for disambiguating both anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities. These statistics, which are derived from sentences that were randomly selected from the corpus, serve as a useful disambiguation tool. Furthermore, the manual acquisition of semantic constraints in broad domains is highlighted as being expensive, emphasizing the value of the automated approach presented in this paper.",
    "The manual acquisition of semantic constraints is a process that encompasses the broader concept of semantic constraints, which are essential for understanding the meanings and relationships of words and phrases. Cooccurrence statistics, which fall under the broader category of statistics, provide valuable insights into the frequency of word pairings within a large corpus, a term that itself is a subset of the broader category known as corpus. The results of the experiment, which are derived from analyzing cooccurrence statistics, also relate to the broader term experiment, highlighting the systematic approach taken in this research. Furthermore, these results can be classified under the broader category of results, which encapsulate the findings of various studies. Additionally, the output of other linguistic tools contributes to the field of linguistic tools, with statistics being generated based on the data produced by these tools."
