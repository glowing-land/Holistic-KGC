The new criterion -- meaning-entailing substitutability -- fits the needs of semantic-oriented NLP applications and can be evaluated directly -LRB- independent of an application -RRB- at a good level of human agreement . Motivated by this semantic criterion we analyze the empirical quality of distributional word feature vectors and its impact on word similarity results , proposing an objective measure for evaluating feature vector quality . Finally , a novel feature weighting and selection function is presented , which yields superior feature vectors and better word similarity performance .",

    "The concept of meaning-entailing substitutability fits well with a new goal and evaluation criterion for word similarity measures. This novel approach, motivated by semantic criteria, proposes a new feature weighting and selection function that presents superior results in distributional word feature vectors. We suggest proposing this new goal as an objective measure for evaluating feature vector quality. The new criterion has broader implications for both the needs of semantic-oriented NLP applications and the evaluation of word similarity results."
