In previous work , we have developed hidden Markov model -LRB- HMM -RRB- and maximum entropy -LRB- Maxent -RRB- classifiers that integrate textual and prosodic knowledge sources for detecting sentence boundaries . In this paper , we evaluate the use of a conditional random field -LRB- CRF -RRB- for this task and relate results with this model to our prior work . We evaluate across two corpora -LRB- conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech -RRB- on both human transcriptions and speech recognition output . In general , our CRF model yields a lower error rate than the HMM and Max-ent models on the NIST sentence boundary detection task in speech , although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by three-way voting among the classifiers . This probably occurs because each model has different strengths and weaknesses for modeling the knowledge sources .",

    "The task of sentence boundary detection in speech recognition has been tackled by various models, including conditional random field (CRF) and hidden Markov model (HMM). Our CRF model yields a lower error rate than HMM on the NIST task. Maximum entropy classifiers have also been developed for this purpose. Previous work has focused on developing these models using corpora of conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech, with both human transcriptions and automated speech recognition output. Each model is designed to capture different aspects of textual and prosodic knowledge sources.",
    "Each of these models has a broader conceptual framework or structure, which represents and organizes knowledge. In other words, each model can be seen as an instance of a more general 'model' that serves to represent, organize, and communicate knowledge."
