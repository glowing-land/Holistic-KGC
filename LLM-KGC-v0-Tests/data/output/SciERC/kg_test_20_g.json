    "This paper presents a separation method that addresses the blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals. The method, which relies on the nonstationarity of the original signals, is shown to be particularly effective for the blind separation of natural speech signals. The separation method is statistically efficient, achieving separation accuracy that meets the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound. It is proposed based on an assumed model, which is a first-order autoregressive model that the independent signals are expected to obey. The original signals, characterized by varying variances in different epochs, are analyzed to extract separated signals that also adhere to the assumed model. Overall, the separation method encompasses various broader terms, including blind separation and state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its significance in the field of signal processing.",
    "Each epoch is part of the independent signals, which are assumed to be piecewise stationary. The first-order autoregressive model is a broader term that encompasses the model used in this context. Natural speech signals, which fall under the broader category of signals, are analyzed in this paper. This paper compares its findings with previous works, highlighting that independent signals are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Furthermore, the separation accuracy of the proposed method is better than that of state-of-the-art methods. The variances of these signals are observed in different epochs, which are themselves broader terms under the concept of epochs."
