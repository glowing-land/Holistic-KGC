    "This paper introduces such phrases, which are a specific type of non-contiguous phrases used in statistical machine translation. It presents a phrase-based statistical machine translation method that is based on these non-contiguous phrases and aims to enhance translation accuracy. The method is proposed for producing phrases from word-aligned corpora, which are essential for generating translations. Such phrases have a broader term, referred to simply as phrases, and the phrase-based statistical machine translation method also falls under the broader category of methods. Additionally, the statistical translation model deals with such phrases and is based on the maximization of translation accuracy, which is measured using the NIST evaluation metric. Translations, the output of this method, are produced by means of a beam-search decoder, which explores multiple possible outputs to select the most likely candidates.",
    "The phrase-based statistical machine translation method allows for better generalization from training data, enhancing its effectiveness in translating text. Experimental results demonstrate how this method operates and validate its performance. Additionally, a training method, which focuses on maximizing translation accuracy, is categorized under the broader term of training method. This training method is specifically based on the maximization of translation accuracy, ensuring that the translations produced are precise and reliable."
