    "The methodology combines techniques such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) or random projection trees to efficiently perform nearest neighbor searches. This approach can be used for a single distance, and it involves explicitly preserving distances by embedding points into higher-dimensional space. The correctness of this methodology has been rigorously established. Additionally, the methodology can be combined with algorithms like LSH or random-projection based methods for 2NN search. These techniques are useful in solving computational problems related to nearest neighbor searches.",
    "LSH, a hashing-based technique used to index and search large datasets efficiently, falls under the broader category of approach. Similarly, nearest neighbor (NN) method also belongs to this approach. Random-projection based methods are another type of approach that has been explored in this domain. Fast algorithms have focused on reducing 2 distance, which is a measure of spatial or numerical separation between two entities. These efficient computational methods belong to the broader category of algorithms. Embedding is a mathematical representation that maps objects from one space to another and also falls under the umbrella of algorithms. The methodology used in these approaches has its roots in the broader approach itself."
