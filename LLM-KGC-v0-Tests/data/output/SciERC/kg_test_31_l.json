In this paper we propose a logical formalism , which , among other things , is suitable for representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear .",

    "Determiners, which include words or phrases that modify nouns and pronouns by specifying their quantity, quality, or relationship to other entities, play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance. However, another problem arises when determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear are involved. To address this issue, In this paper proposes a logical formalism that represents determiners without forcing a particular interpretation. This proposed method or system of logical representation can accurately convey the meaning of determiners, including those with inherent ambiguity."
