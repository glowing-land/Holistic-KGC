    "Utterance Verification (UV) is a method for the UV procedure, which is designed to enhance the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. This paper presents the UV procedure, which is based on three different confidence tests that assess the accuracy of decoded string hypotheses. The UV procedure is critical for the ASR system, as it helps manage out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and acoustic noise, ensuring that the system can effectively handle spontaneous speech. Furthermore, the UV procedure incorporates features such as confidence tests and decoded string hypotheses, which are derived from word and garbage models. The ASR system not only works on real applications but also possesses Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities, which are essential for identifying and managing OOV words and noise during utterance verification. Overall, Utterance Verification is a fundamental function of Automatic Speech Recognition, contributing significantly to the accuracy and reliability of recognized speech.",
    "The 'word and garbage models' are designed to represent both 'noises' and 'out-of-vocabulary' (OOV) words, which are terms not recognized by the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system. Experimental results from a real telephone application demonstrate significant findings, including a reduction in 'recognition errors', a notable 'rejection rate of correct utterances', and instances of 'false acceptance'. The ASR system effectively handles 'acoustic noises' and 'spontaneous speech', ensuring better performance in recognizing natural numbers during the natural number recognition task. To enhance accuracy, 'confidence tests' are applied to 'decoded string hypotheses', with three different confidence tests founded on 'acoustic measures' and 'linguistic information', organized within a hierarchical structure."
