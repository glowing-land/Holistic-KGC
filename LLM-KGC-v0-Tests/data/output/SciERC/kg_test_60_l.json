    "This paper gives an account of a prototype natural language question answering system, which translates English questions into the Prolog subset of logic. The resulting logical expression is then transformed by a planning algorithm to yield efficient Prolog code. This system, Chat-80, implemented entirely in Prolog, has a broader term as a software application or program that operates according to specific rules and procedures. When executed, the Prolog form yields an answer."
