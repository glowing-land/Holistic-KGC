    "This paper discusses the general method of language model adaptation, which involves automatic segmentation of raw corpora using word lists and manual correction of output sentences. The situation where this method is applied allows us to avoid these problems that arise when correcting grammatically complicated positions during sentence-by-sentence error correction. Our method proposes a way to correct the positions in which words appear by adjusting their order or placement within a list. This approach has broader implications for language model adaptation methods, as it can be used with various word lists and raw corpora. Furthermore, our method is applicable not only to segmented corpora but also to situations where grammatically complicated positions are encountered.",
    "A raw corpus, a collection of unprocessed linguistic data, has a broader term 'raw corpus', which refers to a large collection of text data. A variety of methods for preparing a segmented corpus, including our method, have been developed to create divided datasets from this unstructured text. These problems, difficulties encountered when correcting grammatically complicated positions during sentence-by-sentence error correction, can result in a decrease of productivity. To address these issues, we prepared a word list and identified the positions where specific words appear within it. The annotator responsible for correcting errors used our method to achieve this goal. Our proposed adaptation method has been tested through experiments that demonstrated its benefits."
