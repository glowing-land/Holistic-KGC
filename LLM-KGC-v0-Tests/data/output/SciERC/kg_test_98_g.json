    "This paper presents an approach for using distillation queries, which can be associated with annotation elements introduced for the NIST Automatic Content Extraction. Our approach utilizes information extraction annotations to augment document retrieval, which is essential for information distillation. Information distillation aims to extract relevant pieces of information from massive, possibly multilingual, audio and textual document sources, and it has a broader term of document retrieval. Additionally, information distillation is supported by an information retrieval engine that improves two different query templates, enhancing both precision and recall rates. The relationship between relevant pieces of information and queries is significant, as distillation queries are specific types of queries that facilitate this process."
