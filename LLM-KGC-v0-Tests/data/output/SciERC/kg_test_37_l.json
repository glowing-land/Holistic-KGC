    "We describe our system, which recognizes faces using video sequences. This fully automatic face recognition system uses a proposed method that combines photometric and statistical models to achieve nearly perfect recognition rates even with extreme illumination, pose, and head motion variation. The objective of this work is to recognize faces using video sequences for both training and recognition input in realistic scenarios. Face recognition has a broader term, which includes recognizing faces from various data sets such as face images or video sequences."
