    "This paper presents our approach for using information extraction annotations to augment document retrieval for distillation. Our method, which significantly improves precision at various recall rates for two different query templates, leverages the NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) task. We experimentally show that constraining the document set returned by an information retrieval engine with ACE events leads to improved results. Furthermore, our approach has a broader term in automatic content extraction, and we demonstrate its application in distilling essential insights from massive audio and textual document sources."
