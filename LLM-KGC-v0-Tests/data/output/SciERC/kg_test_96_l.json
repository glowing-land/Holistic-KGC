    "We introduce a method to accelerate the evaluation of object detection cascades, which accelerates by more than 50% compared to standard cascade evaluation on PASCAL VOC 2006. This allows us to perform efficient branch-and-bound object detection with nonlinear quality functions using kernel-ized support vector machines. Our proposed method uses classifier functions and a divide-and-conquer procedure in the space of candidate regions, which has been shown to be more effective than the exhaustive procedure."
