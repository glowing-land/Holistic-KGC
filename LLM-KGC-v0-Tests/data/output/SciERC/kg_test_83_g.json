    "This paper presents a comprehensive text collection that includes our recent work focused on harvesting and aligning English-Chinese bitexts of Hong Kong laws from the Web. The resultant bilingual corpus contains 10.4 million English words and 18.3 million Chinese characters, making it a valuable resource for empirical machine translation research. The research details the basic methodology and practical techniques employed, which are reported in detail and encompass broader terms such as techniques and methodology. Furthermore, the exploration of English-Chinese bitexts specifically targets HK laws, utilizing a numbering system in the legal text hierarchy to achieve alignment at the subparagraph level. This structured approach enhances the organization and retrieval of bilingual legal texts, thereby supporting the goals of empirical MT research.",
    "The numbering system is a crucial component of the legal text hierarchy, which provides a structured organization for legal documents. In the realm of machine translation, empirical MT research plays a significant role, as it is a broader term encompassing the field of MT, which focuses on the automatic translation of text. Additionally, empirical MT research is also linked to methodology, indicating that it is guided by systematic frameworks that inform the research methods used in the study of machine translation."
