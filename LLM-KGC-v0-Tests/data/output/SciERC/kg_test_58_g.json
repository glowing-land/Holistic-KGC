    "The concept of system combination provides significant benefits for unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD), as explored in this paper. This paper examines the advantages of system combination, which has a broader term encompassing WSD. Specifically, voting - and arbiter-based combination strategies investigate and are based on a diverse pool of unsupervised WSD systems. These strategies enhance system performance through combination methods, which improve the overall effectiveness of the systems involved. The benefits of system combination are further demonstrated through experiments that utilize the SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets, showcasing ensembles that compare with state-of-the-art techniques in the field. Overall, the diverse pool of unsupervised WSD systems has a broader term of WSD, highlighting the integral role of these systems in advancing the performance of word sense disambiguation."
