    "The estimation of the tensors determines the values of projective unifocal, bifo-cal, and trifocal tensors, which specialize to the affine case. The tensors obtained relate to registered tensors, which are a specific class of tensors that have been previously defined in the literature. Furthermore, projective unifocal, bifo-cal, and trifocal tensors have a broader term, which is tensors. The estimation from line correspondences has a broader term of line correspondences, while the estimation of the tensors from point correspondences has a broader term of point correspondences. The tensors obtained also fall under the broader category of tensors. Affine specialization obtains projective relations that connect points and lines across two or three views, which is a broader term for views. Additionally, bifo-cal, projective unifocal, and trifocal tensors all have broader terms of tensors. The estimation of the tensors from point correspondences is achieved through factorization, and registered tensors also have a broader term in previous work."
