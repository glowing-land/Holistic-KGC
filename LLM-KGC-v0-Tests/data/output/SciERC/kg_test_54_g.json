    "FERRET is a system that describes interactive question-answering, which is a type of system designed to facilitate dynamic exchanges between users and technology. Users interact with this system to gather information relevant to specific scenarios. Within this framework, predictive questioning plays a crucial role as it attempts to identify the answers users need by analyzing their interactions. Furthermore, both FERRET and interactive question-answering have broader terms that encompass Q/A, which refers to automatic question-answering applications. These applications are designed to automatically respond to user inquiries, enhancing the overall user experience."
