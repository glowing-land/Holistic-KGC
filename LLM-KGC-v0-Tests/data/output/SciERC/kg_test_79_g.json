    "Unconstrained MPS grammars are not computationally safe, highlighting a significant limitation in their application. These grammars are a type of metagrammatical formalism that combines context-free phrase structure rules and metarules, which are essential for formulating generalizations about the syntax of natural languages. Metagrammatical formalisms, in general, integrate these elements to provide a framework for understanding linguistic structures. However, proposals aimed at constraining these unconstrained grammars have been evaluated, and none of them satisfies both criteria of computational tractability and explanatory adequacy. In light of these challenges, new directions for research suggest exploring alternative metagrammatical formalisms that could offer safer and more computationally tractable solutions. This research is focused on developing frameworks that can effectively address the limitations of current metagrammatical approaches, ensuring that they meet the necessary criteria for theoretical adequacy."
