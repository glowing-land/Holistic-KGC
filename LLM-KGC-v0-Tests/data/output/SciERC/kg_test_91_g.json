    "This paper presents an approach that is specifically designed for generating images, which are ultimately transformed into pixel-accurate semantic label maps. The approach not only creates these detailed representations but also addresses the challenges associated with creating large datasets with pixel-level labels, a process that requires significant human effort and is costly due to the resources expended. The images used in this process are created from modern computer games, which fall under the broader category of computer games. Furthermore, recent progress in computer vision has been driven by the development of high-capacity models that are trained on large datasets, enhancing the capabilities of image analysis and semantic labeling."
