    "Recent pool models of the inner hair cell synapse have not reproduced the dead time period after an intense stimulus. However, researchers should consider trying Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) than Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). A critical step in encoding sound for neuronal processing is converting analog pressure waves into discrete nerve-action potentials. This process occurs when a crucial stage of auditory processing by onset neurons -LRB- ONs -RRB-. The offset adaptation model that improved phase locking in the auditory nerve has been shown to raise ASR accuracy for features derived from AN fibers, which are used in encoding sound for neuronal processing."
