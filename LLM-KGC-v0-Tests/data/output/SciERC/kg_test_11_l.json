    "The approach, validated by the externally digital architecture, presents high-resolution parallel inner-product computation and its extension to very high dimensions. This mixed-signal paradigm maintains full digital resolution despite low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion. The validation process utilizes real image data, which is suitable for efficient implementation of kernels in image processing. A random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics, enabling the approach to achieve high-resolution parallel inner-product computation."
