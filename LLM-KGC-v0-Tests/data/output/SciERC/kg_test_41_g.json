    "Compositional classes of paraphrases encompass a broader category that includes paraphrase examples, which are instances of sentences conveying the same meaning through different wording. The development of a paraphrase corpus has been an ongoing effort, with our preliminary experiments producing promising results. These experiments have evaluated key metrics such as reliability, exhaustiveness, and cost-efficiency. The promising results obtained are assessed based on these criteria, indicating their quality and effectiveness. Additionally, paraphrase examples are collected through methods like automatic candidate generation and manual judgement, further contributing to the richness of the paraphrase corpus. Sentential paraphrases also fall under the broader term of paraphrase examples, highlighting the diverse ways in which meaning can be expressed."
