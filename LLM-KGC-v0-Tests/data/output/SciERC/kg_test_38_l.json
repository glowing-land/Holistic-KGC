    "We present Minimum Bayes-Risk decoding, which can be used to tune statistical MT performance on a Chinese-to-English translation task. Our results show that MBR decoders perform well under different loss functions, incorporating various levels of linguistic information from word strings. We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that has a broader term in the concept of loss functions itself. The Minimum Bayes-Risk approach is a statistical method that aims to minimize risk or uncertainty by optimizing a probabilistic model. MBR decoders can be used to decode and process data, such as word-strings, word-to-word alignments from an MT system, and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences."
