    "The concept of analogies between words has been refuted by noone, who provided an example illustrating a linguistic relationship between verb phrases. This idea is further supported by the notion that analogies can be found at sentence-level, as demonstrated in experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of such analogies among its contained sentences. The results suggest two estimates: one lower and one higher, which are both part of the broader concept of estimating the number of analogies. Computational linguists seem dubious about this idea, questioning whether it is applicable at sentence-level. Meanwhile, linguistic examples like 'I laughed' being to laugh as I walked is to walk highlight the similarity in structure and meaning between verb phrases."
