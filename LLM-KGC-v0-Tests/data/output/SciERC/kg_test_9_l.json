    "This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach that uses calculating eigenvectors of an adjacency graph's Laplacian to recover a submanifold of data from high dimensionality space and perform cluster number estimation, without requiring labeled training data. The spectral clustering based approach outperforms the other clustering methods on ACE corpora, as shown by experiment results. It works by calculating eigenvectors of an adjacency graph's Laplacian. This unsupervised learning approach disambiguates various relations between named entities by use of various lexical and syntactic features from the contexts."
