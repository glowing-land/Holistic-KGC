    "Our proposed scanning method, mi-cro phase shifting, compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods. It presents a technique for recovering dense sub-pixel camera-projector correspondence without photometric calibration or prior knowledge of their relative geometry. In fact, our method achieves Subpixel accuracy in scene reconstruction. Moreover, simulated and experimental results show that it recovers scene geometry with high precision. Our approach is particularly noteworthy as it outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
