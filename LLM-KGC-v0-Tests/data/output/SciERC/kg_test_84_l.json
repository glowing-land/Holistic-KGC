    "Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) effectively maps bilinear subspaces to line constraints, improving light field triangulation and stereo matching. This approach addresses the issue of direct tri-angulation of these bilinear subspaces leading to large errors. By applying CDT, we can encode 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching, which is particularly useful for scene reconstruction and super-resolution. The geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space play a crucial role in this process, as they improve the accuracy of triangulation problem solutions. Furthermore, our novel algorithm, based on analysis of these geometric patterns, enables efficient graph-cutting for light field stereo matching.",
    "Based on our analysis, we developed a novel line-assisted graph-cut algorithm for encoding 3D lines into light field stereo matching. This paper explores geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space to improve light field triangulation and super-resolution. Our experiments show that both our piecewise-linear interpolant and Triangulation provide useful algorithms for this task."
