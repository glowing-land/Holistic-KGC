    "Our approach incorporates a priori geometric constraints, which are essential for enhancing the accuracy of the 3-D stereo reconstruction scheme. This methodology is based on the iterative deformation of a 3-D surface mesh, allowing for the effective recovery of 3-D shapes. The non-quadratic approach plays a crucial role in enabling satisfactory reconstruction results, particularly when combined with anisotropic meshing. Additionally, numerical constraints are added to the reconstruction process to improve the overall reconstruction results. Triangulations with few vertices are utilized to achieve satisfactory reconstruction results and are a subset of the broader category of triangulations. Furthermore, structural or numerical constraints can also be integrated into the reconstruction process to bolster the accuracy and consistency of the results. The reconstruction results are designed to enforce consistency with a priori knowledge about object shape, thereby improving their overall reliability. In the context of 3-D reconstruction, image information alone is often insufficient to accurately recover the 3-D shape, necessitating the use of these advanced techniques.",
    "A priori knowledge about object shape has a broader term known as object shape, which refers to the geometric configuration of an object. This knowledge is crucial as it enforces consistency with their consistency, ensuring that the reconstruction results align with the geometric constraints. In the realm of 3-D reconstruction, differential features play a significant role, as they not only make the process possible but also serve as useful tools for enhancing the accuracy of the reconstruction. The iterative deformation of a 3-D surface mesh is a key technique that minimizes an objective function, thereby refining the 3-D shape. Additionally, triangulations, which are essential in 3-D surface meshes, utilize vertices to create the triangular elements necessary for effective shape reconstruction."
