    "This paper describes a method for incorporating priming, which is a cognitive process influencing sentence processing, into an incremental probabilistic parser. The paper details three models that are compared, focusing on the priming of rules, which refers to the tendency to repeat structures in language. These models involve the priming of rules between sentences and simulate a reading time advantage for parallel structures, yielding a small increase in overall parsing accuracy. Syntactic priming, a broader term encompassing the tendency to repeat structures, is evidenced in the psycholinguistic literature, which supports the notion that the structures used in one sentence can influence subsequent sentences. Additionally, the models are compared in the context of coordinate structures and sentences, highlighting their relevance in understanding parsing accuracy."
