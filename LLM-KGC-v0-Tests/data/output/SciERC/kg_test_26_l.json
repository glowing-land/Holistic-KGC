    "PageRank uses the event map constructed from documents to rank web pages. The algorithm is used for constructing this event map, which represents events extracted and organized from multiple documents. In an independent approach, we identify important contents by frequency of events in a document-based representation of events. This methodology can be applied to event- based extractive summarization approaches. Experimental results are encouraging, indicating the effectiveness of these techniques."
