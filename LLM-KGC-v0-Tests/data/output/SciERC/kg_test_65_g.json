    "This paper presents a new algorithm that enables efficient novel-view generation, which is based on an improved dynamic-programming stereo algorithm. The new algorithm synthesizes images from a virtual camera, demonstrating its robustness against temporal artefacts, long stereo video streams, and spatial and temporal artefacts. Additionally, the paper introduces a novel algorithm aimed at enhancing the rendering of occlusions and reducing temporal artefacts. The technique employed is fundamentally linked to efficient novel-view generation and the stereo algorithm, showcasing the comprehensive approach taken in this research. Overall, the synthesis of cyclopean views is a broader aspect of novel-view synthesis, which ultimately contributes to the synthesis of images that enhance teleconferencing applications.",
    "The technique is based on novel view generation, which encompasses a broader range of methods for creating new visual perspectives. Within this framework, the synthesis of cyclopean views is a specific application that falls under the general category of synthesis. A key component of this process is temporal maintenance, which serves as a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions. The cost aggregation algorithm acts directly on the three-dimensional matching cost space, improving the accuracy of occlusion rendering. This paper presents two main contributions: a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic programming that encourages correct occlusion labeling, and a compact geometric derivation that is specifically designed for novel-view synthesis. A new algorithm is proposed for one-to-one teleconferencing applications, facilitating eye contact by synthesizing images from a freely translating virtual camera. Demonstrations of synthesis include the generation of cyclopean views and the representation of conversational sequences, showcasing the effectiveness of the synthesis process.",
    "The novel algorithm is a specific type of algorithm that focuses on the temporal maintenance of a background model in teleconferencing applications. This algorithm enhances the rendering of occlusions, which is a broader term encompassing the visual phenomenon where certain parts of a scene are hidden. Demonstrations of synthesis include extended conversational sequences, showcasing how these prolonged interactions can be visually represented. The freely translating virtual camera, which falls under the broader category of cameras, allows for dynamic image synthesis in teleconferencing. Additionally, the cost aggregation algorithm is another type of algorithm that improves occlusion rendering. The virtual camera, also categorized under cameras, simulates camera functionality in a digital environment. The technique employed in this context is based on dynamic-programming, a method that breaks down complex problems into simpler subproblems. Dense-stereo dynamic-programming, which is an advanced algorithm, also belongs to the broader category of algorithms. Long stereo video streams, which provide depth perception, are classified as video streams, highlighting their importance in creating immersive teleconferencing experiences."
