The modified graph is then sent to the UNL-L0 deconverter and the result shown . If is is satisfactory , the errors were probably due to the graph , not to the deconverter , and the graph is sent to deconverters in other languages . Versions in some other languages known by the user may be displayed , so that improvement sharing is visible and encouraging .

    "In this context, UNL graphs are used as part of developing a prototype for sharing text revision across languages. The process involves establishing liaisons between elements of the text and the graph by using broadly available resources such as dictionaries and parsers. This allows naive users to interact directly with the text in their language, while also providing an associated graph that represents interconnected entities or concepts. Furthermore, UNL-0 deconverters are sent to these graphs for converting them into their original L0 representation. The prototype is designed to facilitate cooperative working on multilingual documents and enable improvement sharing across languages.",
    "The development of a prototype for sharing multilingual documents across languages enables naive users to interact directly with text in their language and indirectly with an associated graph. This process, facilitated by liaisons established between elements of the text and the graph using broadly available resources such as dictionaries and canonical transformations, allows cooperative working on a document without losing any information. As new versions are added to the original multilingual document, nothing is ever lost, rendering feasible collaborative editing processes for multilingual documents. The modified graph represents the outcome or product of this process, showcasing the result of merging approaches from interactive machine translation.",
    "The modified graph shows a result. The primary objective of this research project, also referred to as A central goal, aims to merge approaches from multilingual text authoring and pivot MT."
