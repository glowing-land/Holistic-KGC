    "This paper presents novel algorithms for efficient novel-view generation, including a new type of three-plane graph and compact geometric derivation for direct projection of minimum-cost surfaces. The proposed algorithm synthesises images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position to facilitate eye contact in one-to-one teleconferencing applications. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a novel algorithm for the temporal maintenance of a background model to enhance occlusion rendering and reduce spatial and temporal artefacts. Our technique is based on an improved dynamic-programming stereo algorithm that works well with long stereo video streams.",
    "The proposed algorithm synthesises images from a virtual camera, typically located within the monitor to facilitate eye contact. This technique encourages correct occlusion labeling through three-plane graphs. Our improved dynamic-programming stereo algorithm enables efficient novel-view generation and facilitates extended conversational sequences in teleconferencing applications. Additionally, we demonstrate synthesis from freely translating virtual cameras, showcasing synthesized cyclopean views and virtual camera translations.",
    "Video streams are acquired by cameras. We further demonstrate synthesis from a freely translating virtual camera, which falls under the broader category of technique and demonstrations. Dynamic-programming also belongs to this technique family. Furthermore, algorithm can be considered as another type of technique."
