    "This paper proposes to use a convolution kernel, which is a broader term for the convolution tree kernel, as a method for modeling syntactic structure information. The method significantly outperforms the previous two dependency tree kernels, which are classified under the 5 ACE relation major types. The study reveals that the syntactic structure features embedded in a parse tree can be well captured by the convolution tree kernel, enhancing the performance of relation extraction tasks. Furthermore, the method also outperforms dependency tree kernels, demonstrating its effectiveness in relation extraction. The ACE 2003 corpus shows the advantages of this method, which is rooted in the broader category of syntactic structure features derived from parse trees.",
    "Syntactic structure information is used for relation extraction, enhancing the ability to identify and classify relationships between entities in text. Parse trees, which represent the syntactic organization of sentences, have a broader term known as syntactic structure features, highlighting the characteristics derived from word arrangements. The 5 ACE relation major types, which classify primary relations in the ACE framework, also have a broader term, ACE, indicating its foundational role in relation extraction. Similarly, feature-based methods, which utilize specific characteristics to improve model performance, relate to ACE relation subtypes, a set of 24 specific categories defined within the ACE corpus. This interconnectedness illustrates the importance of these concepts in the field of natural language processing."
