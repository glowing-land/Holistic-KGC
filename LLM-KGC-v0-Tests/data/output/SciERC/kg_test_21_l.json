    "This paper proposes relation extraction and these features can be well captured by the convolution tree kernel. It reveals that syntactic structure features embedded in a parse tree are very effective for relation extraction, which can be well captured by the same method. The proposed approach outperforms previous two dependency tree kernels on the 5 ACE relation major types. Evaluation shows that this method achieves comparable performance with previous best-reported feature-based methods on the 24 ACE relation subtypes.",
    "The convolution kernel, a mathematical operation used to extract relevant features from image or signal data, can be seen as a specific method for solving problems. Similarly, previous best-reported feature-based methods are also types of methods that have been employed in various applications."
