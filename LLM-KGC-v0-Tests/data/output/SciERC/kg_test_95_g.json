    "This paper describes the generating process of speech F0 contours, which is a statistical modeling approach that involves the fundamental frequency (F0) of speech. It deals with the problem of generating the fundamental frequency contour of speech, specifically from text input for text-to-speech synthesis. To address this challenge, the paper proposes extending a statistical model, which is based on the discrete-time version of the Fujisaki model. This model is further enhanced by incorporating a context-dependent approach, which improves the association of model parameters with text inputs. The generating process of speech F0 contours is characterized by its relation to raw F0 contours and encompasses broader terms such as speech F0 contours and F0 contours. Additionally, the present model is based on decision tree-based context clustering, which aids in the effective training of the statistical model for generating natural-sounding speech.",
    "The fundamental frequency (F0) contour of speech is a crucial aspect of text-to-speech synthesis, which involves the challenge of generating a natural pitch variation from text input. This problem encompasses the fundamental frequency itself and is closely related to the broader field of text-to-speech synthesis. The Fujisaki model serves as a theoretical framework for this process, with its parameters being estimated from raw F0 contours, which are the unprocessed data representing the pitch variations in speech. An efficient algorithm, derived from a statistical model, is employed to optimize these parameters, utilizing powerful statistical methods. This paper proposes a parameter training algorithm specifically designed for the present model, which extends the Fujisaki model to enhance the generation of speech F0 contours. Overall, the generating process of speech F0 contours is integral to achieving effective text-to-speech synthesis.",
    "The problem of generating the fundamental frequency (F0) contour of speech involves text input, which is essential for creating natural pitch variations in synthesized speech. The Fujisaki model, a theoretical framework for F0 contour generation, is a specific type of statistical model. This paper, which presents research on this topic, falls under the broader category of papers. The model discussed in this paper is also classified as a statistical model and is related to various algorithms, including an efficient algorithm designed to estimate the parameters of the Fujisaki model. Additionally, the Fujisaki-model parameters are associated with text input, highlighting their importance in the synthesis process. Techniques such as decision tree-based context clustering and parameter training algorithms are also broader terms under the category of algorithms, emphasizing their role in optimizing the generation of F0 contours."
