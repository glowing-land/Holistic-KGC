    "The paper presents an unlexicalized parser for German, which employs smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2. This model has been shown to be effective in parsing German text without using pre-defined word meanings. The use of smoothing in this unlexicalized parser allows us to better examine the interplay between smoothing and parsing results."
