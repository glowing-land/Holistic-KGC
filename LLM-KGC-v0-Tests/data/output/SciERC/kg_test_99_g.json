    "This paper introduces an innovative approach that presents a novel representation for three-dimensional objects. The approach is particularly applicable to cluttered scenes, as it does not require a separate segmentation stage. By combining multi-view constraints with a normalized representation, the method facilitates matching and reconstruction, allowing for the acquisition of three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models. The preliminary modeling and recognition results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in recognizing three-dimensional objects from multiple images taken from arbitrary viewpoints. Furthermore, the recognition results highlight the capability of the method to identify three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models within a single photograph. Affine-invariant image patches play a crucial role in this process, as they are related to the spatial relationships that define how objects are positioned in space."
