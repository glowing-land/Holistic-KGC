    "Verbal and nonverbal grounding acts are essential components of nonverbal grounding acts, which are utilized by embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to facilitate communication. These agents rely on both verbal and nonverbal grounding acts, as well as signals, to effectively update the dialogue state during interactions. The use of verbal and nonverbal means for grounding is crucial, as it not only investigates but also establishes common ground among participants. In the context of direction-giving tasks, nonverbal behaviors such as head nods and eye gaze are analyzed to understand their role in communication. Head nods and eye gaze are broader terms under nonverbal behaviors and nonverbal means, respectively, and their usage can differ depending on the type of dialogue move being employed. Ultimately, signals play a significant role in establishing common ground, which is vital for successful human-computer interaction, a field that encompasses the design and use of ECAs.",
    "The overall pattern in human-computer interaction is reflected in the lack of negative feedback, which indicates the effectiveness of dialogue moves. In this context, attentional focus is analyzed during the direction-giving task, where participants engage in providing verbal and nonverbal directions. Furthermore, attentional focus encompasses broader terms such as nonverbal behaviors and nonverbal means, highlighting the importance of various forms of communication that do not rely on spoken or written language."
