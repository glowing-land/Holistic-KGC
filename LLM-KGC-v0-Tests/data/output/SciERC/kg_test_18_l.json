    "This paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for using demonstrative expressions in English, discussing their implications on discourse processing algorithms. The research also explores anaphoric expressions, which are a type of linguistic phenomenon where pronouns or other words refer back to previously mentioned entities, concepts, or ideas. Furthermore, the results of this study will be incorporated into a natural language generation system that is genre-dependent and can process texts in various forms."
