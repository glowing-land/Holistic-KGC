    "We identify three important requirements that emerged from our laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique for carrying out tasks requiring data retrieval, such as database access. These requirements include operators specific to the task of database access, complex contextual reference and reference to the structure of the information source. In this paper's second half, we report a laboratory study using the same technique to identify NL requirements for solving a specific task. Our findings suggest that future Natural Language systems should be designed with these demands in mind, including operators specific to database access, complex contextual reference, and reference to the structure of the information source. The evaluation of such approaches is crucial to ensure their validity.",
    "A prototype Natural Language system has been developed to process and understand human language. This system arose from the task that we gave our subjects, which required data retrieval from a database given to them to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task. The operators specific to the task of database access have been designed to interact with databases efficiently. However, previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in terms of their ability to meet these NL requirements. Furthermore, tasks requiring data retrieval are common and can be categorized under a broader term - 'task'."
