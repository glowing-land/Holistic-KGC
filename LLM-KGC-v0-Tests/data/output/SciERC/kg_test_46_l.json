    "The problem of reconstructing the motion of a 3D articulated tree from 2D point correspondences subject to some temporal prior has been tackled by various approaches. One such approach, with time complexity growing exponentially in the number of frames, yields a hard combinatorial problem. To address this issue, reconstruction without estimating cameras extends traditional methods by leveraging affine projection and eliminating the need for camera parameter estimation. This extension enables efficient motion reconstruction without camera estimation. However, as the number of frames scales linearly with dynamic programming approach, the complexity remains an open challenge. Branch and bound strategies have been attempted to curb this complexity. In contrast, they provide no guarantee of being more efficient than exhaustive search. Hitherto, encouraging smooth motion has been a key consideration in reconstructing 3D articulated tree motion from 2D point correspondences."
