    "A novel part-of-speech tagger, referred to as 'the resulting tagger', has a broader term of both 'tagger' and 'part-of-speech tagger'. This new tagger achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97.24% on the widely used Penn Treebank WSJ corpus. The development of this innovative part-of-speech tagger is attributed to its demonstration of several key ideas."
