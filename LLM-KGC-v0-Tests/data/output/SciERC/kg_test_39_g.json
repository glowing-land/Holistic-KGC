    "This paper uses the Wizard of Oz technique to evaluate a specific task related to data retrieval. The task is assessed through the collection of task dialogues, which are gathered using this technique. The paper identifies NL requirements that are essential for carrying out this task, which has broader implications for the general concept of task. Furthermore, the evaluation of Natural Language systems is linked to future Natural Language systems, indicating a progression in the field. The study reveals three important requirements that arose from the task given to subjects, which are crucial for the development of prototype Natural Language systems. These requirements are part of a broader category of requirements necessary for effective Natural Language systems. The paper concludes with a critical discussion that raises questions about the methodologies used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems, emphasizing the need for context-aware approaches.",
    "The Wizard of Oz technique has a broader term known as approaches, which encompasses various strategies for evaluating Natural Language systems. Future Natural Language systems are satisfied by existing Natural Language systems and are also categorized under the broader term systems. Task dialogues are specifically placed upon a prototype Natural Language system, which is designed to assess the requirements for effective data retrieval. The task that we gave our subjects falls under the broader category of task, emphasizing the importance of evaluating systems in the context of their use. However, previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems adequately, raising questions about the validity of such approaches. These questions highlight the need for a critical discussion of the various methodologies employed in assessing Natural Language systems. Furthermore, the requirements for these systems include managing complex contextual references and understanding the structure of the information source, which are essential for successful task execution.",
    "The requirements for effective Natural Language systems include operators specific to the task of database access, which are essential for retrieving and manipulating data. A laboratory study identifies NL requirements that are crucial for these systems, utilizing the Wizard of Oz technique to simulate interactions and gather insights. The second half of the paper elaborates on these findings, presenting a critical discussion that evaluates the methodologies used in assessing Natural Language systems. Within this context, a task requiring data retrieval is defined as solving data retrieval problems, which is a broader term encompassing various tasks related to database access. Furthermore, the reference to the structure of the information source highlights the importance of understanding the organization of data, which is vital for effective data retrieval."
