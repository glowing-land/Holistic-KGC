    "We present a novel model-based approach to recover the shapes and poses of transparent objects from known motion. This shows how features that are imaged through a transparent object behave differently from those that are rigidly attached to the scene. We have applied it to real scenes that include transparent objects and recovered the shapes of the objects with high accuracy. The perception of transparent objects from images is known to be a very hard problem in vision, but our approach has successfully tackled this challenge by recovering the shapes of complex objects composed of multiple layers with different refractive indices.",
    "This research paper, 'In this paper, we explore what can be said about transparent objects by a moving observer', explores the perception of transparent objects from images taken by a moving observer. The poses of these transparent objects are determined by their movement and orientation within an image. Our algorithm uses simulations to recover shapes and poses of transparent objects from single images, which is a very hard problem in vision. Unlike features that are rigidly attached to the scene, those imaged through transparent objects can appear distorted due to refraction. The authors have conducted numerous simulations to evaluate their proposed approach."
