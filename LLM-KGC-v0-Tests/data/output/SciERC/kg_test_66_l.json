    "A method for automatically collecting statistics on cooccurrence patterns in a large corpus, which reflect semantic constraints and can be used to disambiguate anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities. This paper presents an automatic scheme for collecting such statistics, implemented by gathering data from other linguistic tools. The results of this experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of using these statistics to resolve pronoun references in randomly selected sentences."
