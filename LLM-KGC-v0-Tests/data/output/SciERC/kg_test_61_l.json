    "This paper proposes a multi-task end-to-end Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network that captures complex long-range temporal dynamics. The proposed model automatically localizes the start and end points of actions more accurately, which is essential for online action detection from streaming skeleton data. This network has been designed to study the problem of identifying and tracking actions in real-time using skeletal data. In this paper, we demonstrate our approach on a large streaming video dataset, including G3D, which contains well-segmented 3D skeleton data. Our model can be used for various applications such as human action recognition, online action detection, and subtask optimization."
