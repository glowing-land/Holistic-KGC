  "summary": "In the study of expressive speech communication , it is commonly accepted that the emotion perceived by the listener is a good approximation of the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker . This paper analyzes the validity of this assumption by comparing the mismatches between the assessments made by na \u00a8 \u0131ve listeners and by the speakers that generated the data . The analysis is based on the hypothesis that people are better decoders of their own emotions . Therefore , self-assessments will be closer to the intended emotions . Using the IEMOCAP database , discrete -LRB- categorical -RRB- and continuous -LRB- attribute -RRB- emotional assessments evaluated by the actors and na \u00a8 \u0131ve listeners are compared . The results indicate that there is a mismatch between the expression and perception of emotion . The speakers in the database assigned their own emotions to more specific emotional categories , which led to more extreme values in the activation-valence space .",

    "The database assigned their own emotions to more specific emotional categories, which was based on an analysis that compared actors and naive listeners. This study led to a deeper understanding of how speakers assign their own emotions to more specific emotional categories. The paper analyzes the validity of this assumption, suggesting that people are better decoders of their own emotions. Using the IEMOCAP database, researchers found that the emotion perceived by the listener is often a good approximation of the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker. This study also highlights the importance of expression and perception of emotion in understanding human communication.",
    "A study revealed that speakers' self-assessments of their own emotions, which are often more extreme than intended emotions, can lead to a discrepancy between emotional assessments made by speakers and naive listeners. This phenomenon was observed through an analysis of the IEMOCAP database, which contains categorical and continuous emotional assessments. The results showed that people are better decoders of their own emotions, supporting the hypothesis that individuals have an innate ability to accurately recognize and understand their own emotional states. Furthermore, expressive speech communication plays a crucial role in conveying emotions, attitudes, and intentions through verbal or nonverbal means."
