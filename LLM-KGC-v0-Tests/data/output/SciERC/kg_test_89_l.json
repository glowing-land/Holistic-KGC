    "Utterance Verification (UV) procedures are based on three different confidence tests, two of which rely on acoustic measures and one founded on linguistic information. A new UV procedure has been developed, featuring two major features: a confidence test for decoding string hypotheses representing out-of-vocabulary words and acoustic noises, as well as another feature based on linguistic information. This approach is designed to deal with the challenges posed by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which must contend with Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities. The new UV procedure has been shown to be effective in a real telephone application, achieving an impressive 50% reduction in recognition errors through experimental results."
