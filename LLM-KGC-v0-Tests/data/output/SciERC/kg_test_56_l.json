    "We introduce a novel method of shape constrained image segmentation, which combines Bayesian statistics with mixtures of feature distributions for color and texture as well as probabilistic shape knowledge. This approach has been formulated to account for the robust-ness requirement in image understanding. The automated segmentation requires shape information and is based on this novel method. In essence, it's a systematic procedure that ensures reliable results when segmenting images into semantically meaningful parts.",
    "Experimental evidence shows that semantically meaningful segments are inferred. This inference relies on Bayesian statistics, which provides a broader framework for making decisions under uncertainty. Furthermore, this method can be seen as an approach to achieve specific goals."
