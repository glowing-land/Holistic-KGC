    "Offset adaptation is crucial for auditory processing by onset neurons, which play a significant role in encoding sound information. This model, referred to as OA, is a specific instance of offset adaptation and is essential for enhancing auditory processing. Zhang et al. proposed the offset adaptation model, which improves phase locking in the auditory nerve, thereby raising ASR accuracy. The relationship between offset adaptation and auditory processing is further emphasized, as offset adaptation has a broader term that encompasses auditory processing. Onset neurons, which are integral to auditory processing by onset neurons, also fall under this broader category. Additionally, ON-based auditory features, derived from the processing of sound by onset neurons, have a broader term of features, which includes novel features and features derived from AN fibers. The encoding of sound occurs when an analog pressure wave is transformed into discrete nerve-action potentials, facilitating auditory processing. Furthermore, the MSG (Modulation-filtered Spectrogram) method enhances auditory features, which are critical for effective sound analysis and processing.",
    "Auditory processing is facilitated by onset neurons, which play a crucial role in the perception and interpretation of sound. Phase locking, a phenomenon that synchronizes neuronal firing with sound waves, is a broader term encompassing auditory processing. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a technology that enhances auditory processing by converting spoken language into text. Within this context, Modulation-filtered Spec-troGram (MSG) serves as a method for extracting auditory features, which are essential for improving ASR accuracy. Features derived from auditory nerve fibers (AN fibers) are critical for encoding sound, a process that falls under the broader category of neuronal processing. The auditory nerve, which includes AN fibers, transmits sound information to the brain and is involved in phase locking. The conversion of analog pressure waves into discrete nerve-action potentials is vital for sound encoding, and these potentials are further categorized under nerve-action potentials. Researchers working with novel features are encouraged to explore Multi-layer perceptrons, which have shown to perform better than Gaussian mixture models in auditory processing tasks. Additionally, Zhang et al. represent a group of researchers contributing to the understanding of auditory processing and synaptic models."
