    "This paper describes a spectral clustering based approach, which is a specific type of unsupervised learning approach that effectively disambiguates various relations between named entities. The experiment results on ACE corpora show that this spectral clustering based approach outperforms the other clustering methods, highlighting its effectiveness in the domain. The spectral clustering based approach, as well as spectral clustering in general, falls under the broader category of clustering methods. Additionally, the unsupervised learning approach performs cluster number estimation, which is crucial for determining the optimal number of clusters in the data. This process involves calculating eigenvectors, which are used to recover a submanifold of data derived from a high dimensionality space. The experiment results on ACE corpora are part of the broader term of experiment results, which encompass the findings obtained from applying this method to the ACE datasets."
