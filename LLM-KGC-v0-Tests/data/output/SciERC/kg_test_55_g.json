    "This paper introduces an annotation scheme designed for scientific articles, which is characterized by its reproducibility and intuitive usability. The annotation scheme can be used to build such a resource, which is a broader term encompassing various training resources. Within this framework, the seven categories of the scheme are based on rhetorical moves, which are strategic techniques in argumentation. Furthermore, the annotation scheme is stable, ensuring consistent results across different applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the annotation scheme, highlighting its relevance in the context of scientific articles and its broader implications in the field of argumentation."
