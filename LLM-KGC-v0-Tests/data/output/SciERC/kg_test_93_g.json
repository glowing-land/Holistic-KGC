    "Language resource quality significantly affects the impact of using different-quality references, which is a central theme described in this paper. The paper highlights how the varying quality of reference translations, which are a subset of resources, influences evaluation outcomes in natural language processing (NLP). Resources, including reference translations, are derived from data created by human beings, emphasizing the importance of high-quality data in the evaluation process. Furthermore, validation of these resources is widely recommended before their use in NLP applications to ensure their reliability. The limitations of the automatic metrics used in machine translation (MT) are also discussed, revealing challenges in accurately assessing translation quality. Overall, language resource quality is crucial in NLP, as it encompasses various aspects of resources and their evaluation.",
    "The impact of using different-quality references is a significant aspect of references, which serve as essential sources in academic work. In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), automatic evaluations are crucial as they need high-quality data to effectively assess the performance of translation systems. Different-quality references also fall under the broader category of references, highlighting the varying levels of quality that can influence evaluation outcomes. Within the NLP context, which is a subset of NLP, high-quality data is vital as it allows for a comprehensive comparison of both automatic and human translations. This high-quality data is categorized under data, which is fundamentally created by human beings. Furthermore, reference translations, another form of references, are high-quality data produced by humans and are used as benchmarks in evaluations. This paper, which examines these dynamics, is classified under the broader term of paper, emphasizing the importance of understanding how different-quality references affect evaluation scores in machine translation."
