    "The approach utilizes a mixed-signal paradigm, which is presented for high-resolution parallel inner-product computation. At the core of this approach is the externally digital architecture, which supports a low-power analog array performing binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication. This approach has been validated with real image data and experimental results. Within this framework, analog summation is a key process that combines binary products, and it is closely related to random statistics that arise from this summation. The CID/DRAM analog array prototype, implemented in a cost-effective 0.5 cents m CMOS technology, serves as a practical application of this paradigm. Additionally, a random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics, which are essential for maintaining full digital resolution despite the challenges posed by low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion.",
    "Low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion is a specific type of analog-to-digital conversion, which serves as a broader category encompassing various methods of transforming analog signals into digital form. In the realm of image data, real image data represents a subset that falls under the broader term of image data, which includes all digital representations of visual information. Additionally, kernels, which are essential mathematical functions in image processing, also fall under the broader term of image processing, highlighting their role in enhancing and analyzing digital images."
