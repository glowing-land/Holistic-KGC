    "Unconstrained MPS grammars are a type of grammar that combines context-free phrase structure rules and metarules, but lacks computational safety. We suggest new directions for research on alternative metagrammatical formalisms to explore concise statement of generalizations about natural language syntax. However, we show that none of these proposals satisfies both criteria of explanatory adequacy. Instead, we evaluate several proposals for constraining MPS grammars and find that they do not meet the necessary standards."
