    "This paper presents a bio-inspired model that simulates the image processing mechanisms of the vertebrate retina, enabling advanced spatio-temporal dynamics for early vision applications in VLSI technology. The design challenges and trade-offs encountered in the development of this model are discussed in detail within the paper, alongside the experimental results obtained from testing. The bio-inspired model facilitates the realization of complex programmable spatio-temporal dynamics, which are crucial for effective image processing. Furthermore, the model is based on studies related to the vertebrate retina, highlighting its biological inspiration. The prototype chip designed and fabricated using a 0.5 \u00b5m standard CMOS process demonstrates exceptional computing power per area and power consumption, achieving levels that are amongst the highest reported for a single chip."
