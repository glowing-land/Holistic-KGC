    "Researchers presented an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points. This work presents a strong detector based on combining multiple weak detectors, which achieves high detection rates with rejection to pathological motion and occlusion. The authors modelled this phenomenon as regions containing two different layers moving over each other, causing many image processing techniques to fail. Novel priors were used to generate sparse and dense detection maps, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.",
    "This work presents novel statistical assumptions or distributions used for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points. The technique combines many image processing techniques that fail when dealing with multiple layers or reflections, and instead uses a strong detector based on combining a set of weak detectors to produce a stronger detection outcome. The results are represented as sparse and dense detection maps. Additionally, the work involves motion estimation and object recognition, which is achieved through the process of estimating motion patterns in images and recognizing objects within those motions."
