In this paper We experimentally evaluate a trainable sentence planner for a spoken dialogue system by eliciting subjective human judgments . In order to perform an exhaustive comparison , we also evaluate a hand-crafted template-based generation component , two rule-based sentence planners , and two baseline sentence planners . We show that the trainable sentence planner performs better than the rule-based systems and the baselines , and as well as the hand-crafted system .",

    "This paper has a broader term, namely 'paper', which describes the experimental evaluation of a trainable sentence planner for a spoken dialogue system. The trainable sentence planner as well as hand-crafted systems are compared and evaluated."
