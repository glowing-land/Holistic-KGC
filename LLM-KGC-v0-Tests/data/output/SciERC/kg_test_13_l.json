  "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun . In Thai language , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun , both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers . Basically , there is no exact rule for classifier selection . As far as we can do in the rule-based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun . Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types are open due to the meaning of representation . We propose a corpus-based method -LRB- Biber ,1993 ; Nagao ,1993 ; Smadja ,1993 -RRB- which generates Noun Classifier Associations -LRB- NCA -RRB- to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase . The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences .",

    "In Thai language, the choice of classifier for each noun is governed by Registration, which assigns and limits classifiers to unit classifiers. The fluctuation in choosing a classifier for a given concrete noun can be attributed to the lack of fixed rules governing this process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a corpus- based method that generates Noun Classifier Associations. This approach involves selecting an appropriate classifier word for each noun using algorithms that determine grammatical categories or parts of speech.",
    "The NCA was created from and has its roots in a large corpus. This statistical construct represents a conceptual framework organized according to hierarchical relationships, drawing upon the vast collection of texts or documents used to create associations between nouns and their corresponding classifiers. Furthermore, concrete nouns are classified under the broader term 'noun', which refers to words that represent people, places, things, or ideas."
