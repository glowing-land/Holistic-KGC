    "This paper highlights a particular class of miscommunication, reference problems, which can arise when a listener interprets a speaker's utterance. The current research aims to enrich human-machine interactions by recognizing and isolating these misunderstandings. By presenting techniques for avoiding failures of reference, the authors aim to improve communication between humans and machines. Moreover, this work recognizes that mistakes or miscommunications can lead to broader misunderstandings, which in turn slow down or even break down communication.",
    "This paper highlights the concept of miscommunication, specifically reference problems, and presents techniques for avoiding failures of reference. Miscommunications can slow down or even break down communication between individuals. To recognize and isolate such miscommunications, we need to identify instances where misunderstandings occur in natural language environments. In human-machine interactions, speakers may not be assured to have the same beliefs as listeners, which can lead to difficulties in interpreting utterances. Enrichment of these interactions requires a framework that is less restrictive than earlier ones, allowing for increased speaker autonomy and flexibility. Ultimately, this enrichment enables better communication between humans and machines."
