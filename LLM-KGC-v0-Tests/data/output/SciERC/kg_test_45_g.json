    "This work introduces an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences, which consist of multiple layers that complicate image processing tasks. The automated technique analyzes the motion trajectories of feature points to effectively detect these reflections. Reflections in image sequences can be modeled as regions containing two different layers, which are moving over each other. Additionally, reflections are related to pathological motion and occlusion, both of which are broader terms that encompass the challenges faced in detecting reflections. The detection process employs a set of weak detectors, which when combined, form a strong detector that enhances the overall detection performance. This strong detector is based on the integration of these weak detectors, allowing for improved identification of reflections in complex scenarios.",
    "Regions containing two different layers are a broader term that encompasses layers, which are crucial in understanding the complexities of image processing. The high detection rate of automated techniques is particularly effective in addressing challenges posed by pathological motion and occlusion, ensuring accurate identification of reflections in image sequences. These reflections complicate image processing techniques, which often fail as they assume the presence of motion estimation and object recognition. To enhance detection capabilities, novel priors generate sparse and dense detection maps, which are essential for analyzing the motion trajectories of feature points. These trajectories, which are broader terms for both feature points and motion trajectories, play a significant role in the overall effectiveness of image processing methodologies."
