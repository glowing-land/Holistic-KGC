    "Our goal is to develop and optimize a metric learning formulation for computing a Mahalanobis distance that minimizes a loss function based on the weighted sum of precision at different ranks. To achieve this, we derive an efficient non-linear extension of Weighted Approximate Rank Component Analysis (WARCA) by using the kernel trick. This novel algorithmic approach enables more effective metric learning and distance computation while addressing matrix rank degeneration & non-isolated minima in low-rank matrix optimization. Moreover, we show that minimizing a weighted rank loss is a natural criterion for person re-identification, which has broader implications for many problems in computer vision such as person re-identification. Furthermore, our approach decouples the training and prediction costs from the data dimension using Kernel space embedding."
