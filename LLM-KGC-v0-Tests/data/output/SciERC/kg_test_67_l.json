    "Our novel method for discovering parallel sentences in comparable, non-parallel corpora presents a reliable approach to determine whether two given sentences are translations of each other. This method uses the extracted data and can be applied with great benefit to language pairs. A good-quality MT system can be built from scratch by starting with -LRB- 100,000 words -RRB-. We show that this approach has been successfully used to extract parallel data from large Chinese, Arabic, and English non-parallel newspaper corpora. This extracted data is then exploited to build a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.",
    "In this study, we train a maximum entropy classifier to analyze language pairs such as Chinese, Arabic, and English. The parallel data used for training has its broader term in general data. Furthermore, newspaper corpora are also categorized under the umbrella of data."
