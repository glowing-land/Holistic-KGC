    "The application of synchronous TAGs relates expressions of natural languages to their associated semantics or translates them into another language. We discuss some computational issues that arise when interpreting this formalism for semantic purposes or natural language translation. The unique properties of tree-adjoining grammars (TAGs) present a challenge for applying them beyond the limited confines of syntax, which is why we need synchronous TAGs to characterize correspondences between languages and relate expressions of natural languages to their associated semantics represented in a logical form language, or to their translates in another natural language. This formalism applies to concrete examples and has broader implications for tasks such as automatic translation of natural language."
