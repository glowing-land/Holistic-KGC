    "This paper describes a novel system designed to acquire 30 distinct adjectival subcategorization frame types (scf types) from English corpus data. The system is capable of detecting these scf types and achieves a recall rate of 66%. It also acquires frequency information related to adjectival subcategorization frames, demonstrating a precision of 70% in the experiments conducted. The grammatical relations (grs) identified by the system are classified into hierarchical frames, enhancing the understanding of how adjectives interact with other elements in sentences. Additionally, the system incorporates a decision-tree classifier that tests for the presence of these 30 scf types, further solidifying its role as a tool for linguistic annotation of scfs in corpus data.",
    "The new tool for linguistic annotation of scfs is a specialized software that falls under the broader category of tools designed for linguistic annotation. This system acquires English corpus data, which is a subset of corpus data, and utilizes a powerful pattern-matching language to classify grammatical relations known as grs. The system is capable of achieving 70 % precision in identifying scf types, which indicates a high level of accuracy in its operations. Additionally, the training and test data for subcategorization acquisition is essential for the process of obtaining training and test data, thereby facilitating subcategorization acquisition. The pattern-matching language not only classifies grs but also mirrors the structure of inheritance-based lexica, allowing for a hierarchical classification of frames. Overall, this tool alleviates the challenges associated with the systematic collection and preparation of linguistic data.",
    "The process of obtaining training and test data encompasses the systematic collection of datasets, which includes the subset known as test data. In the realm of linguistic analysis, grammatical relations are crucial and are identified in the output of a robust statistical parser. This parser serves as a computational tool that interprets the grammatical structure of sentences. Additionally, a decision-tree classifier is employed to test for the presence of these grammatical relations, ensuring that the relationships between constituents are accurately classified. Furthermore, the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of this system fall under the broader category of experiments, highlighting the systematic investigations aimed at assessing various outcomes."
