    "This paper describes a novel system for acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames (scfs) and associated frequency information from English corpus data. The system, which incorporates a decision-tree classifier for 30 scf types, is able to detect scf types with 70% precision and 66% recall rate. A new tool introduced in this paper can considerably alleviate the process of obtaining training and test data for subcategorization acquisition by annotating adjectival subcategorization frames (scfs) in corpus data. The system uses a powerful pattern-matching language to classify grammatical relations into hierarchical subcategorization frames, mirroring inheritance-based lexical structures."
