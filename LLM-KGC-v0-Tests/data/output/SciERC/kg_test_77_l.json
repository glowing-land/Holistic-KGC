    "The logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in P\u00f3lya-gamma augmentation enable us to reformulate multinomial distributions using latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods. This framework has practical applications for modeling problems involving discrete data, such as DNA sequences, children's names over time, and text documents. In these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws, whether it be nucleotides in a sequence or topics in text that are highly correlated from year to year. The dependencies between these draws can be modeled using multinomial or categorical distributions, which are reformulated as latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods."
