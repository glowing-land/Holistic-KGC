    "The proposed methods evaluate the joint source-channel transliteration model through transliteration/backtransliteration experiments. This paper presents a framework that allows for direct orthographical mapping between two different languages. The n-gram transliteration model, which is a broader term for the joint source-channel transliteration model, is revealed in the study to improve transliteration accuracy while also reducing system development effort. The framework is further proposed to model the transliteration process, which encompasses the methodologies involved in machine transliteration and back-transliteration.",
    "The n-gram transliteration model is a specific instance of the broader transliteration process, which encompasses various methods for converting text between different scripts. Within the realm of multilingual speech and language applications, machine transliteration and back-transliteration play a crucial role, facilitating communication across linguistic barriers. Recent transliteration and backtransliteration experiments have focused on the English/Chinese and English/Japanese language pairs, which are part of the larger category of languages. Both English/Japanese and English/Chinese serve as examples of language pairs that are essential for these studies. The proposed methods, which include the joint source-channel transliteration model, are categorized under methods that aim to enhance the transliteration process. Additionally, direct orthographical mapping is a technique within a novel framework designed to improve machine transliteration and back-transliteration, further contributing to the effectiveness of these methods."
