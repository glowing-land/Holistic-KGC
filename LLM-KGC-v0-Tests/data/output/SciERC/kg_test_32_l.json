    "We investigate verbal and nonverbal grounding acts, proposing a design for embodied conversational agents that relies on both kinds of signals to establish common ground in human-computer interaction. These grounded dialogue states are updated through verbal and nonverbal behaviors used by ECAs. Our analysis reveals the importance of eye gaze, head nods, and attentional focus in monitoring lack of negative feedback. The distribution differed depending on the type of dialogue move being grounded."
