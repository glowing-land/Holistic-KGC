    "This paper presents an unlexicalized parser for German, which is a type of model that achieves a remarkable labelled bracket F-score of 76.2. The high accuracy of the model is attributed to its effective use of smoothing and suffix analysis, which are techniques that enhance parsing results by addressing data sparsity and morphological variations. The unlexicalized parser not only employs these techniques but also allows for the examination of the interplay between smoothing and parsing results, indicating a complex relationship that contributes to its overall performance. Furthermore, the smoothing and parsing results interplays with parsing results, highlighting the significance of these methods in achieving high accuracy in parsing tasks."
