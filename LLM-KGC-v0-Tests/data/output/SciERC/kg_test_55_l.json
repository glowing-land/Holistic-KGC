    "The seven categories are based on rhetorical moves of argumentation. An annotation scheme for scientific articles has a broader term, which is itself an annotation scheme with a broader term - simply put, it's a scheme. Our experimental results show that this annotation scheme works well. This paper introduces the proposed framework, which categorizes information into seven distinct groups."
