    "To recover from inevitable tracking failures, we consider object detection as a global optimization problem and solve it via Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), which avoids becoming trapped at local modes and is much faster than exhaustive search. Our numerical hybrid local and global mode-seeing tracker uses ASA to recover from these failures by stochastically sampling the parameter space. In normal tracking conditions, we use local optimization for normal object detection, but when common prediction techniques like the Kalman filter do not provide a good estimate of object parameters in future frames, our approach solves this problem via Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA). Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on VIVID benchmark datasets. We renew and redetect objects as needed.",
    "Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) uses a Monte Carlo approach to stochastically sample the parameter space, unlike local deterministic search. ASA's broader term is an approach that optimizes global minima. When objects become partially or totally occluded, they are prone to failure with traditional trackers like local tracker. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on VIVID benchmark datasets by applying cluster analysis and sampling the parameter space of translation, rotation, and scale."
