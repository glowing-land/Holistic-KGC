    "This paper describes a search procedure for statistical machine translation, which is based on dynamic programming. The DP-based solution presented in this paper incorporates a novel technique that restricts word reordering, enhancing the efficiency of the search algorithm specifically for the translation direction from German to English. The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task, a limited-domain spoken-language task that evaluates the translation of spoken dialogue. Additionally, the DP-based solution is recognized as a solution to the traveling salesman problem, illustrating its broader applicability. The search restriction is particularly useful for the translation direction from German to English, ensuring that word reordering occurs effectively between the source and target languages. Overall, the research contributes to the field of statistical machine translation, which encompasses various methodologies, including MT."
