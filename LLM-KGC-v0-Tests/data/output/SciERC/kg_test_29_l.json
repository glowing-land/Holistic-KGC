    "A novel approach for machine transliteration/backtransliteration, which involves direct orthographical mapping between two different languages and uses a joint source-channel transliteration model. This framework allows us to carry out direct orthographical mapping between English/Chinese and English/Japanese language pairs. Our study reveals that the proposed methods reduce an extensive system development effort while improving transliteration accuracy. The proposed methods are evaluated through transliteration/backtransliteration experiments, which play a crucial role in multilingual speech and language applications."
