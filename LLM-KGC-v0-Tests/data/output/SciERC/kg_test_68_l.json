    "This paper presents a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language, based on dynamic programming. The experimental tests carried out on the Verbmobil task demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In particular, it achieves an efficient search algorithm for statistical machine translation in the German-English direction. This is achieved by restricting the possible reorderings of words between the two languages, which enables a more accurate and efficient search procedure."
