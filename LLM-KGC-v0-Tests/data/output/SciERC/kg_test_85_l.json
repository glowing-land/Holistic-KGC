    "This paper presents a phrase-based statistical machine translation method that allows for better generalization from training data. The proposed method deals with non-contiguous phrases, which are broader terms of regular phrases. A computational approach based on the maximization of translation accuracy uses NIST evaluation metrics to optimize its performance. This paper also introduces a beam-search decoder algorithm used to produce translations. Statistical models present non-contiguous phrases and deal with them using phrase-based statistical machine translation methods."
