    "In this study, we first investigate how well the addressee of a dialogue act can be predicted based on gaze, utterance and conversational context features. Then, we explore whether information about meeting context can aid classifiers' performances. Our results show that both Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers perform best when combining conversational context, utterance features, and speaker's gaze information. Furthermore, our findings indicate that adding information about meeting context does not significantly improve the performance of these classifiers."
