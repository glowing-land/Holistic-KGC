    "This paper presents recent work on harvesting English-Chinese bitexts of Hong Kong laws from the Web and aligning them to the subparagraph level. The resultant bilingual corpus, containing approximately 10.4 million English words and 18.3 million Chinese characters, comprises a comprehensive collection of bilingual texts covering the specific domain of HK laws. Empirical MT research is valuable for this paper's findings. Our recent work has also laid a foundation for exploring and harvesting English-Chinese bitexts in a larger volume from the Web. The methodology used to harvest these bitexts involves aligning them to the subparagraph level via utilizing the numbering system in the legal text hierarchy, which provides an authoritative and comprehensive text collection covering this specific domain."
