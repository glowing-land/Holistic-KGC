    "The research paper presents an innovative method for analyzing and recognizing online cursive handwriting using a cycloidal pen motion model. This motor control representation enables successful word spotting and matching of cursive scripts, which are then quantized into a small number of values without altering the writing intelligibility. The approach uses these parameters to enable on-line cursive handwriting analysis and recognition, presenting a general procedure for estimating and quantizing cycloidal motion parameters. Cycloidal pen motion is described by two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of the writing. The result is a discrete motor control representation of continuous pen motion via the quantized levels of model parameters, which enables word spotting and matching of cursive scripts.",
    "The result, a tangible outcome or product resulting from a process or experiment, can be represented by various models. A motor control representation, which symbolizes underlying processes for modeling and simulation of behavior, has broader terms such as model. Similarly, parameters that describe slow modulations with constant linear drift along the line of writing have broader terms like amplitudes and phase lags, cycloidal motion parameters, or simply parameters."
