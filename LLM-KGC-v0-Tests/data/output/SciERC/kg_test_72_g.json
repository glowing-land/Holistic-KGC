    "A unified account of sentence-level and text-level anaphora operates within the framework of a dependency-based grammar model, providing insights into text-level anaphora. This account incorporates an adapted version of a Grosz-Sidner-style focus model, which enhances the understanding of how references are made across larger text structures. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive view of anaphora, which serves as a broader term encompassing various aspects of reference in language. The relationship between Government and Binding (GB) theory and binding theory is significant, as GB is related to the principles that govern the relationships between pronouns and their antecedents. Furthermore, anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries is a specific process that has a broader term, anaphora resolution, and it rephrases major concepts from GB's binding theory. Both text-level anaphora and anaphora resolution share this broader categorization under the term anaphora."
