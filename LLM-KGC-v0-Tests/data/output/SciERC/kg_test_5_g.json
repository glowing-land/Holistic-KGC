    "The automated interpretation of nominal compounds in English is a specific application of automated interpretation, which utilizes a domain-independent model. This model is applied to the interpretation of compounds in real texts, where it accounts for productive rules of interpretation that are inferred from the morpho-syntactic and semantic characteristics of nominal constituents. The principles concerning predicative information associated with nominals and predicative information itself have broader terms, namely semantic principles and generalizable semantic principles, which help distinguish between generalizable and domain-specific semantic information. Additionally, complementary semantic information is retrieved for the interpretation of compounds in real texts, enhancing the understanding of nominal compounds. Overall, the domain-independent model is proposed for the automated interpretation of nominal compounds, facilitating a systematic approach to analyzing their meanings."
