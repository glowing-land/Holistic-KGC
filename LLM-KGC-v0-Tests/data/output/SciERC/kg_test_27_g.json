    "Our method is a specific implementation of a scanning method that achieves high subpixel precision and recovers dense sub-pixel camera-projector correspondence. This scanning method, which also requires knowledge of relative geometry and photometric calibration, is enhanced by techniques such as mi-cro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting, both of which fall under the broader category of scanning methods. Simulated and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in recovering scene geometry. Additionally, our method increases robustness to indirect lighting by utilizing gray-level band-pass white noise patterns. Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering zero-crossings defined by the differences between unstructured patterns. When compared to state of the art methods, our method shows significant advancements in precision and performance.",
    "State of the art methods are often compared to modulated phase shifting, highlighting the advancements in techniques used for various applications. Notably, state of the art methods include modulated phase shifting, which serves as a key component in enhancing the precision of camera-projector correspondence in active reconstruction systems."
