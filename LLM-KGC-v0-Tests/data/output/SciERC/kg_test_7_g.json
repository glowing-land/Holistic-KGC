    "Plume, also known as a restricted domain parser, is a specialized system developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. This paper outlines the capabilities of Plume and describes our detailed design, which extends its functionality. Plume is based on semantic caseframe instantiation, which enhances its efficiency and robustness. However, it also leads to patchy syntactic coverage, particularly when handling complex structures such as relative clauses, passives, and interrogatives. Despite these limitations, Plume is well adapted to processing simple declarative and imperative utterances, benefiting from the advantages of efficiency on grammatical input. This efficiency allows it to effectively process grammatical input while maintaining robustness in the face of ungrammatical input. Our detailed design aims to improve Plume's handling of relative clauses, further enhancing its syntactic coverage.",
    "Our detailed design effectively handles both passives and interrogatives, enhancing the Plume parser's capabilities. This design is associated with the advantages of efficiency on grammatical input, which in turn possesses robustness, allowing the parser to maintain performance even when faced with ungrammatical input. Furthermore, robustness in the face of ungrammatical input is a broader term that encompasses the general concept of robustness, indicating the parser's ability to process linguistic expressions that do not conform to standard grammatical rules. Plume, a restricted domain parser developed at Carnegie-Mellon University, builds on previous work at the institution, ensuring that it can effectively manage the complexities of ungrammatical input."
