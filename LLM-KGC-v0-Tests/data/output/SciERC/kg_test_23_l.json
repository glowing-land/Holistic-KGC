    "Our work on detecting question-answer pairs in email conversations for the task of email summarization has a broader term, which is email summarization. This paper presents research that focuses on improving upon lexical similarity of discourse segments for question-answer pairing using features based on the structure of email threads. These features can be used to improve upon sentence extraction as an approach to summarizing documents of certain genres. Furthermore, our work has a broader term, which is task. The process or goal of condensing and highlighting essential information from emails, also known as email summarization, is itself a task that aims to achieve a specific objective."
