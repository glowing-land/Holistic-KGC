    "This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank. We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon consistent with CCG principles, which has broader implications for obtaining a lexical resource that adheres to these principles. The induced lexicon is part of the broader concept of a linguistic framework that proposes a compositional approach to grammar and semantics, specifically Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). Turkish dependency treebanks are smaller than Penn WSJ datasets but still provide valuable insights into language theories such as agglutination and free word order. The fact is that Turkish is an agglutinating free word order language."
