    "To overcome the challenge of acquiring necessary training data for learning confidence measures in stereo vision, we propose a new, flexible, and scalable way for generating training data that only requires a set of stereo images as input. This approach uses the KITTI2012 dataset to automatically generate training data. The key idea is to use different viewpoints for reasoning about contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the same stereo algorithm. Our approach enables us to acquire the necessary training data, which involves manual interaction, active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes. This way boosts three learned confidence measures on the KITTI2012 dataset.",
    "Our approach, which encompasses manual interaction, active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes, has a broader term that includes learned confidence measures. This systematic method also involves outlier removal and can be applied in both fully automated manner as well as through manual interaction."
