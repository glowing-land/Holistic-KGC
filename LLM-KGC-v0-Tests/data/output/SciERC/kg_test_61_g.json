    "This paper presents a study on the problem of online action detection, which involves streaming skeleton data. It proposes a model known as the Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network, which addresses the challenges of online action detection by employing a joint classification and regression optimization objective. This network is capable of localizing the start and end points of actions while exploring various action types. Furthermore, it demonstrates promising performance in detecting and localizing actions, capturing the complex long-range temporal dynamics inherent in the data. The proposed model ensures high computational efficiency, making it a significant advancement in the field of online action detection, which is recognized as more challenging than traditional human action recognition.",
    "Online action detection is a crucial method that identifies various action types and localizes their corresponding action positions in real-time from continuous video streams. The Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network plays a significant role in evaluating a large streaming video dataset, which is built with annotations to enhance the detection process. Within this framework, action types and action positions are broader terms that encompass the specific actions being detected. The model effectively avoids the inefficiencies associated with a typical sliding window design, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to capture complex temporal dynamics. Furthermore, regression optimization is employed to forecast actions, providing the ability to anticipate actions prior to their occurrence. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed scheme, validated through evaluations on both our dataset and the public G3D dataset, which is specifically designed for human action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton data.",
    "The G3D dataset is a specific type of dataset that serves as a public resource for evaluating human action recognition algorithms. Similarly, a streaming video dataset also falls under the broader category of datasets, which are structured collections of data used for various analytical purposes. Recent experimental results have demonstrated promising performance, showcasing the effectiveness of a multi-task end-to-end Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network in detecting and localizing actions from streaming skeleton data. Additionally, the ability to forecast the action prior to its occurrence is an important aspect of predictive modeling, which is encapsulated within the broader term of forecast."
