    "The logical formalism is suitable for representing determiners, which play an important role in conveying the meaning of an utterance. However, another problem with determiners is their inherent ambiguity, which complicates their interpretation. This paper proposes a logical formalism that addresses this issue, particularly when their meaning is still not clear. Both their meaning and the meaning of an utterance have a broader term, meaning, which encompasses the ambiguity associated with determiners. Furthermore, methods to grasp the global meaning of a sentence seem more important than determiners, as they also relate to the broader concept of meaning. Overall, the logical formalism presented in this paper aims to provide clarity in the face of ambiguity."
