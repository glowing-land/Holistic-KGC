    "This domain-independent model may be applied to the interpretation of compounds in real texts, provided that complementary semantic information are retrieved. The model accounts for productive rules of interpretation and can be used across different domains without being specific to any particular field of study. In contrast, Pustejovsky's principles concerning the predicative information associated with nominals highlight the importance of domain-specific semantic details required to apply a domain-independent approach. We argue that it is necessary to draw a line between generalizable semantic principles and domain-specific semantic information."
