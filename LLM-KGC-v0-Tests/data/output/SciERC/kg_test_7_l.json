    "This paper outlines Plume, a restricted domain parser that has limitations in handling complex sentence structures such as passives, relative clauses, and interrogatives. While Plume is well adapted to simple declarative and imperative utterances, it handles these complexities in an ad hoc manner leading to patchy syntactic coverage. To address this issue, the paper describes our detailed design for extending Plume to handle passives, relative clauses, and interrogatives in a general manner. This approach has the advantages of efficiency on grammatical input."
