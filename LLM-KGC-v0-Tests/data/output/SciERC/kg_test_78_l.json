    "MINPRAN, a robust operator for handling large outlier percentages in data sets, distinguishes good time stamps (ts) from those that are randomly generated from random data. It assumes the bad data and searches for accurate ts and nearly correct numbers of inliers by using its properties to compare favorably with least median of squares. MINPRAN also handles complex range and intensity data effectively, applying its methodology to process such datasets. Furthermore, it applies to related work on applications of robust operators like itself to handle outliers in various domains."
