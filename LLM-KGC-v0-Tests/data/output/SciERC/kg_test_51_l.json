    "This paper compares three incremental probabilistic parser models that simulate the reading time advantage for parallel structures found in human data, and also yield a small increase in overall parsing accuracy. The models involve priming of rules between sentences, within sentences, and within coordinate structures. Syntactic priming plays a crucial role here, as it influences one's linguistic behavior by previous exposure to similar grammatical structures. This phenomenon is well-documented in psycholinguistic literature, which provides evidence for syntactic priming. Furthermore, the paper describes a method for incorporating this effect into an incremental parsing process, allowing for more accurate and efficient parsing of text."
