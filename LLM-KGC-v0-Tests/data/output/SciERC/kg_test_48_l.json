    "Researchers have been investigating the problem of learning to predict moves in the board game of Go from game records of expert players. This distribution has numerous applications in computer Go, including serving as an efficient stand-alone Go player. To tackle this challenge, we obtain a probability distribution over legal moves for professional play in a given position. Our method consists of two major components: a pattern extraction scheme and a Bayesian learning algorithm trained on 181,000 expert games. This system is capable of predicting moves made by professional Go players with excellent performance."
