    "The number of analogies is estimated by analyzing analogies between words, which are a subset of the broader category of analogies. A specific example of such an analogy is illustrated by the relationship 'I walked : to walk : : I laughed : to laugh', which highlights the connection between past tense verbs and their infinitive forms. Additionally, analogies between sentences also fall under the broader term of analogies, although computational linguists are often dubious about their validity compared to word analogies. The estimates of the number of analogies are represented by two estimates, which include a higher one and a lower one, both of which are broader terms for estimates. These estimates are derived from experiments that aim to quantify the number of analogies, ensuring that they must be valid on the levels of meaning and form.",
    "A multilingual corpus contains analogies and sentences, serving as a rich resource for linguistic analysis. Within this corpus, the phrase 'I laughed' is related to the action 'to laugh', illustrating the connection between specific verb forms and their infinitive counterparts. The concept of 'similar meanings' is a broader term that encompasses 'meaning', which is crucial for ensuring that translations maintain semantic equivalence. Translation processes are rigorously tested for their ability to preserve these similar meanings, thereby validating the analogies drawn from the corpus. Furthermore, experiments are conducted on the multilingual corpus to explore these relationships and enhance our understanding of language."
