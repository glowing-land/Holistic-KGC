    "The proposed approach is designed to perform camera handoff, facilitating the seamless transition of tracking objects across multiple PTZ cameras in wide-area surveillance scenarios. This approach effectively associates objects and demonstrates its capabilities through multiple PTZ camera sequences. In this context, the slave camera follows a target, which is a broader term encompassing various objects. The master camera also relates to these objects, while multiple PTZ cameras are categorized under the broader term PTZ camera. Previous approaches relied on geometric, appearance, or correlation-based information, which are less effective in these scenarios. Notably, the slave camera bootstraps itself from the imagery it captures, avoiding the need for model transfer. The approach shows a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its advancements in the field.",
    "Previous approaches have limitations that hinder their effectiveness in certain scenarios. Specifically, these limitations are not extendable to wide-area settings, which involve the use of multiple PTZ cameras for surveillance. As a result, the traditional methods fall short in addressing the complexities presented by expansive environments."
