    "The relevant approach and the independent approach are both methodologies that fall under the broader category of approaches used in event-based extractive multi-document summarization. These approaches investigate how to identify important contents from documents. The relevant approach specifically identifies important contents by utilizing the PageRank algorithm, while the independent approach identifies important contents based on the frequency of events. Events are defined as specific terms that are associated with event elements, which are broader components linked to these events. The frequency of events serves as a statistical measure to determine the significance of important contents. An event map, constructed from various documents, organizes these events and their associated elements, allowing the PageRank algorithm to be effectively applied. The experimental results from these methodologies have been encouraging, indicating their potential effectiveness in summarization tasks."
