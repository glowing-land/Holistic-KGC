    "Topical blog post retrieval incorporates textual credibility indicators, which enhance the effectiveness of this task that focuses on ranking blog posts. These indicators estimate the retrieval approach and are integrated into the retrieval process, improving its overall performance. Within this context, two groups of indicators are considered: blog level and post level, both of which are essential for evaluating the credibility of blog posts. Textual credibility indicators serve as a broader term for credibility indicators, which in turn encompass various metrics known as indicators. Experiments on the TREC Blog track test set demonstrate that the use of credibility indicators significantly boosts retrieval performance, achieving the best performance by effectively combining both post-level and blog-level indicators. Additionally, the blog level indicators are determined using information about the underlying blogs, further enhancing the relevance of the retrieval process.",
    "The best performance in retrieval effectiveness is achieved when combining them, which refers to the integration of post-level and blog-level credibility indicators. The post level is determined using information about individual blog posts, which are distinct entries published on blogs. Relevance for a given topic, which indicates how pertinent blog posts are to a specific subject, has a broader term known as topic. Credibility indicators play a crucial role as they improve retrieval effectiveness by assessing the trustworthiness of blog posts. The process of ranking blog posts, which evaluates their relevance, has a broader term encompassing all blog posts. Similarly, the blog level, which assesses credibility at the blog level, has a broader term that includes blogs. The retrieval approach utilized in this context is based on language models, which are computational tools designed to understand and generate human language. Individual blog posts, as well as underlying blogs, also have broader terms that refer to blogs, highlighting the interconnectedness of these entities."
