    "This paper proposes a generic mathematical formalism that facilitates the combination of elementary structures, which include strings, trees, graphs, and products. This formalism simulates various grammar formalisms such as Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG), Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), rewriting systems, and dependency grammars. The mathematical formalism encompasses broader terms like structures, which are influenced by the polarization of elementary structures, controlling the saturation of the final structure. Additionally, the products formed from these structures are integral components of the overall framework, demonstrating the versatility and applicability of the proposed formalism in simulating complex syntactic representations.",
    "In the realm of mathematical concepts, structures include various mathematical objects such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Rewriting systems are a specific type of formal system that falls under the broader category of grammar formalisms, which themselves are encompassed by the even broader term mathematical formalism. Within the framework of grammar formalisms, several specific types exist, including Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), dependency grammars, and Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), all of which contribute to the understanding and application of syntactic and semantic relationships in language."
