    "A compact lexicon is obtained from a treebank, specifically the Turkish dependency treebank, which itself is a type of treebank. The Turkish dependency treebank has a broader term, which is simply a treebank. The principles of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) are consistent with a compact lexicon, indicating that the lexicon aligns with the theoretical constructs of CCG. Additionally, a treebank is smaller than the Penn WSJ, which also has a broader term of treebank. The compact lexicon, in turn, has a broader term known as lexicon. Furthermore, the agglutinating free word order language presents a challenge for language theories, a challenge that is similarly posed by Turkish."
