    "The program, which supports GLOSSER, enables reading and learning to read in foreign languages. Specifically, it facilitates translation between English-Hungarian, English-Bulgarian, and French-Dutch language pairs. Moreover, as a broader term of both The Program and ICALL, the concept of 'program' encompasses various software applications designed for specific tasks or operations, including UNIX."
