    "Automatically acquiring English topic signatures can be useful in a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Text Summarisation. Our method presents a novel approach for automatically acquiring these topic signatures that takes advantage of differences in word sense lexicalization between English and Chinese, as well as large amounts of available Chinese text. We evaluated the topic signatures on a WSD task, where we trained a second-order vector cooccurrence algorithm on standard WSD datasets with promising results."
