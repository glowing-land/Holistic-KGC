    "This paper addresses a specialized regression problem by proposing an efficient solution using the regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm, which is specifically designed to solve such problems. The paper provides a principled and provable solution that is parameterless and does not require any data insights, ensuring that it can effectively obtain sampling probabilities for database records. This specialized regression problem is a subset of a broader category referred to as 'problem', which also includes standard regression problems. The principled and provable solution contributes to the overarching goal of sampling a small set of records from databases, which facilitates the efficient and accurate evaluation of aggregate queries. Furthermore, the ERM algorithm yields a theoretical generalization result, reinforcing its applicability in deriving sampling probabilities. The loss function in this context is characterized by its inverse proportionality to the regressed-to values, distinguishing it from traditional regression approaches.",
    "In the context of regression analysis, 'the loss' is a term that has a broader definition encompassing the concept of 'loss', which measures error in a specialized regression problem. When discussing data management, 'records' are individual entries stored in 'databases', which serve as structured collections of data. The process of 'evaluating aggregate queries' can be performed using 'aggregate queries', which summarize or compute values over sets of data records. Recent findings indicate that 'extensive experimental results' demonstrate improvements over both 'standard stratified sampling' and 'uniform sampling', both of which are recognized as 'industry standards'. Furthermore, a 'cost zero solution' can exist under 'hard budget constraints', and such a solution can only be excluded by these strict financial limitations. Notably, 'extensive experimental results' also encompass a broader category known as 'experimental results'."
