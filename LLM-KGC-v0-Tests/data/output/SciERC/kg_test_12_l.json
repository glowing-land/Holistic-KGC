    "In computer vision, affine cameras provide a simpler geometric interpretation of trifocal tensors. The trifocal tensor has constraints on its components for affine cameras, relating to registered tensors from previous work. Bifo-cal and projective unifocal tensors specialize to the affine case, providing an intuitive understanding of their structure. Tensors represent multi-dimensional arrays used in computer vision, including trifocal tensors that describe projective relations between points and lines across three views."
