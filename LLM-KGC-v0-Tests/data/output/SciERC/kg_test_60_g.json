    "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of Chat-80, a prototype natural language question answering system designed to efficiently translate English questions into the Prolog subset of logic. Chat-80 is implemented entirely in Prolog, which is based on logic, and it has been designed to be efficient and easily adaptable to a variety of applications. The system translates English questions into logical expressions, which are then executed in Prolog form to yield answers. The Prolog subset of logic, which encompasses the logical constructs used in Chat-80, has a broader term of logic and is itself a part of the programming language category. Overall, Chat-80 serves as a prototype for various applications, showcasing the capabilities of efficient Prolog in processing natural language inquiries.",
    "Extraposition grammars are also known as logic-based grammar formalism. The resulting logical expression, which is a representation of an English question, has a broader term known as logical expression. Efficient Prolog, a refined subset of the Prolog programming language, also falls under the broader category of programming language. Prolog itself is categorized as a programming language based on logic. The resulting logical expression is transformed by a planning algorithm, which in turn transforms efficient Prolog. Additionally, query optimisation in a relational database is a concept that has broader terms, including query optimisation and relational database. Query optimisation involves the use of relational databases to enhance the efficiency of database queries."
