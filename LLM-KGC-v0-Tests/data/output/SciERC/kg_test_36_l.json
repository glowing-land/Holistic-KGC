    "The problem of computing involves calculating the Kullback-Leibler distance, also known as relative entropy. This measure has a solution for the cross-entropy, which represents a specific part of this distance between probabilistic context-free grammars and probabilistic finite automata. In fact, the Kullback-Leibler distance is another name for relative entropy. Probabilistic context-free grammars have been approximated by means of probabilistic finite automata, with both types of formal languages using probability theory to generate strings according to certain rules."
