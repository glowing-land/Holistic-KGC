    "Our algorithm proposes a novel probabilistic framework for learning visual models of 3D object categories by combining appearance information and geometric constraints. This generative framework uses a model that captures the relative position of parts within each of the discretized viewpoints, which enables detection and classification tasks. Given a new image, this process involves determining the position and viewpoint of the model that maximizes recognition scores for candidate objects. Our approach contrasts with mixture-of-viewpoints models, as it establishes explicit correspondences between different object class viewpoints.",
    "Our algorithm, which combines appearance information and geometric constraints, learns visual models of 3D object categories. These models are represented as a coherent ensemble of parts that are consistent under 3D viewpoint transformations. We test our model on two challenging datasets: Savarese et al. (2007) and PASCAL VOC 2006. Our approach is among the first to propose explicit correspondences between different viewpoints, unlike existing mixture-of-viewpoints models. The promising results we show demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in detecting and classifying objects from different viewpoints.",
    "Our research methodology, also known as Our approach, can be seen as having a broader term - probabilistic framework. This statistical approach or methodology uses probability theory to model and analyze uncertain events or outcomes."
