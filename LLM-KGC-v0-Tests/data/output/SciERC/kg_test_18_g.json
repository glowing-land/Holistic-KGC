    "This research is part of This paper, which discusses the implications for current discourse processing algorithms and presents the necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of demonstrative expressions in English. Furthermore, This research is also part of a larger study of anaphoric expressions. The distribution of demonstrative forms and functions is genre dependent, indicating that their usage varies across different genres of texts. This distribution has broader terms, including demonstrative forms and functions, functions, and demonstrative expressions. Additionally, the implications for current discourse processing algorithms relate to the broader category of discourse processing algorithms. Texts analyzed in this study show how the distribution of demonstrative forms and functions operates within various contexts. Ultimately, This research will be incorporated into a natural language generation system, contributing to the understanding of anaphoric expressions.",
    "Demonstrative forms, which include expressions like 'this' and 'that', are used in English to indicate specific entities in discourse. The results from a larger study of anaphoric expressions will be incorporated into a natural language generation system, enhancing its ability to produce human-like text. This larger study of anaphoric expressions is part of a broader term known as research, which systematically investigates the use and distribution of such linguistic elements."
