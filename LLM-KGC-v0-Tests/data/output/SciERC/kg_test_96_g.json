    "Our method, which is a novel approach for accelerating the evaluation of object detection cascades, speeds up the search process significantly. It accelerates the evaluation of object detection cascades compared to the exhaustive procedure, which is the standard cascade evaluation method. The last stage of our method integrates efficient subwindow search, enhancing performance further. This method employs a divide-and-conquer procedure that operates in the space of candidate regions, allowing for more efficient evaluations. Additionally, kernel-ized support vector machines are utilized in branch-and-bound object detection, which is a key aspect of our method. The results from the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset demonstrate an impressive acceleration of more than 50%, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach over traditional methods."
