    "We propose combining anisotropic meshing with a non-quadratic approach to regularization, which enables us to obtain satisfactory reconstruction results using triangulations with few vertices. This approach can be added locally to the reconstruction process through a constrained optimization scheme, incorporating priori geometric constraints. Our method is based on iteratively deforming and minimizing an objective function applied to a 3D surface mesh. The strong description and modeling properties of differential features make them useful tools that can efficiently be used as constraints for 3D reconstruction. Structural or numerical constraints can then be added locally to the reconstruction process through a constrained optimization scheme, which has broader implications for our approach. By incorporating priori knowledge about object shape into the reconstruction process, we improve and enforce their consistency with these shapes."
