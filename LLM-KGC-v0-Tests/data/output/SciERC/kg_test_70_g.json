In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances -LRB- called the linguistic structure -RRB- , a structure of purposes -LRB- called the intentional structure -RRB- , and the state of focus of attention -LRB- called the attentional state -RRB- . The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate . The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them .

    "This paper presents a new theory of discourse structure, which is an extension of the existing theory of discourse structure and explores its components. The new theory provides a framework for understanding the theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances, which is illustrated within this paper. Additionally, the theory of discourse structure is a component of intentional structure and emphasizes the role of purpose and processing in discourse. The paper also explores intentional structure, which is included in the new theory. Furthermore, the components of discourse structure have a broader term that encompasses both the new theory and the overarching theory itself. Overall, this paper highlights the interrelated nature of these theories and structures, contributing to a deeper understanding of discourse.",
    "The discourse structure has a broader term known as the theory of discourse structure, which provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances. Within this framework, components include the intentional structure, which captures discourse-relevant purposes. A new theory of discourse structure stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse, emphasizing how these elements are interrelated. Purpose itself has a broader term that encompasses components and is integral to understanding the dynamics of discourse. Additionally, the aggregation of utterances is illustrated in this paper, showcasing how segments are grouped to reflect the underlying linguistic structure. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances also has a broader term, theory, which relates to intention, further illustrating the interconnectedness of these concepts. Overall, the relationships among these entities highlight the complexity of discourse and the various theoretical frameworks that seek to explain it.",
    "The discourse structure has a broader term known as theory, which encompasses various frameworks for understanding how discourse is organized. Within this framework, segments are identified as having a broader term of a new theory of discourse structure, which emphasizes the interrelated components that make up discourse. The discourse structure itself is composed of components, which include linguistic structure and attentional state, both of which are essential for processing within discourse. Furthermore, the properties of discourse are described in relation to the discourse, highlighting the characteristics that influence communication. The behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions also falls under the broader term of discourse, illustrating their role in the dynamics of communication. Recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse is another critical aspect, as it is a broader term that contributes to understanding the overall structure. The theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in this paper, providing insights into how these elements interact within the utterances of the discourse. Overall, the segments of the discourse are recognized as having a broader term of discourse, which encapsulates the various components and processes involved in effective communication.",
    "The concept of tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state is integral to understanding discourse, as it monitors the flow of conversation. This is further supported by a framework for describing the processing of utterances, which also falls under the broader term of discourse. Example discourses are illustrated in this paper, showcasing how segments, utterances of the discourse, and information from the discourse all contribute to the overall structure. Discourse-relevant purposes are expressed in segments of the discourse, while the intentional structure captures the relationships among these purposes. The intentions expressed in the discourse are recognized within the broader context of discourse, highlighting their significance. Additionally, the sequence of utterances is categorized under linguistic structure, which organizes the discourse. The operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state tracks the discourse, emphasizing the role of purpose and processing in understanding utterances. The distinction among these components is essential to provide insights into discourse phenomena, as information derived from the discourse involves various aspects of communication. Overall, the theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances encompasses these elements, reinforcing their interconnectedness within the realm of utterances.",
    "The distinction among these components is essential to provide a clear understanding of interruptions, which are a specific type of discourse phenomenon. Example discourses serve as illustrations of the broader concept of discourse, which encompasses various elements including interruptions. Within this framework, linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse, which are crucial for organizing utterances. Discourse processing, another broader term, relates to the cognitive activities involved in recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse, which in turn connects to the concept of intention. The framework for describing the processing of utterances is part of the broader category of processing, highlighting the cognitive mechanisms at play. The attentional state, which records relations among the components of discourse, is fundamental for tracking the discourse through its dynamic nature. Segments, as natural groupings of utterances, contribute to the overall discourse structure. Properties of discourse, including the behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions, are essential for understanding the utterances of the discourse. Recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse is also linked to the broader category of utterances of the discourse, as is the linguistic structure itself. Overall, the relationships among intentions are vital for grasping the nuances of intention within discourse.",
    "The process of tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state encompasses the utterances of the discourse, which are integral to understanding communication. Cue phrases serve as a broader term within the discourse, guiding the listener's comprehension. The properties of discourse are characterized by the properties that influence how utterances are structured and understood. A framework for describing the processing of utterances is essential for analyzing the intentions expressed in the discourse, which are fundamentally linked to the concept of intention. The attentional state is closely associated with the operation of mechanisms that manage focus during discourse, recording salient properties as the conversation unfolds. Discourse processing, a vital area of study, requires recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and tracking the dynamics of attentional states. The relationships among intentions are crucial for understanding how these intentions interact within the discourse. Furthermore, the behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions highlights the dynamic nature of discourse, particularly in relation to interruptions. Information derived from the discourse is rooted in the utterances that form its structure. Recognizing how the utterances aggregate into segments is essential for understanding the overall coherence of discourse.",
    "In the study of discourse processing, information encompasses the utterances of the discourse, which are essential for understanding communication. The relationships among intentions are fundamental connections that fall under the broader category of relationships, highlighting how various purposes expressed in discourse interact. The attentional state, which is an abstraction of the focus of attention, plays a crucial role in discourse as it records the salient objects that participants are aware of during the conversation. Linguistic structure is composed of utterances, which aggregate into segments, forming the backbone of discourse. Furthermore, information from the discourse is a broader term that includes all relevant data derived from the interactions. Example discourses and interruptions also fall under the category of utterances of the discourse, illustrating different aspects of communication. The behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions is explored within the framework for describing the processing of utterances, which is essential for understanding how these elements function in discourse. Overall, discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances aggregate into segments, thereby facilitating a deeper comprehension of the dynamics at play.",
    "Cue phrases are a subset of utterances of the discourse and play a significant role in guiding communication. They are part of the broader category known as discourse phenomena, which also includes referring expressions. The behaviour of cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions is explored in relation to referring expressions, highlighting their interconnectedness. Information is crucial in discourse, as the role of information comes from the broader concept of information itself, which involves participants engaged in the discourse. The processing description specifies how this information is utilized, emphasizing the importance of participants' knowledge of the domain. This knowledge, which relates to the specific domain being discussed, is essential for understanding the focus of attention, which represents what participants are currently attending to during the conversation. Overall, participants possess knowledge that encompasses both their understanding of the domain and the broader information context, which influences their interactions and interpretations within the discourse."
