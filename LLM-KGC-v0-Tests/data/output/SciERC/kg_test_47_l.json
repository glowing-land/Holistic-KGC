    "To improve topical blog post retrieval, we describe how to estimate textual credibility indicators. The best performance is achieved when combining both post-level and blog-level indicators. Experiments show that these indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness. We also discuss two groups of indicators: one based on individual blog posts only and another based on information from the underlying blogs. These indicators have a broader term, which is textual credibility indicators. Topical blog post retrieval has a broader term, which is the retrieval process. A language-based approach for ranking blog posts with respect to their relevance for a given topic also falls under this category."
