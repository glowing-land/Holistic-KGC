    "This paper proposes a statistical approach to blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals, assuming piecewise stationarity with varying variances and first-order autoregressive models. The problem of blind separation is addressed through a method relying on nonstationarity of the original signals. This model is shown to be more appropriate for blind separation of natural speech signals compared to previous works and state-of-the-art methods.",
    "This model can be seen as an extension of existing mathematical algorithms or techniques used to solve specific problems. Similarly, previous works are a collection of research studies that have been published previously on various topics."
