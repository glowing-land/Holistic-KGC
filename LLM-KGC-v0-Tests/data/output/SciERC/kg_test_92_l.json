    "Our proposed approach, which combines partial scene segmentation hints from multiple soft binary mattes to generate multiple segmentations of an image without top-down knowledge. This novel step toward unsupervised object discovery builds on recent advances in spectral clustering and image matting techniques. Rather than trying to find or define a single 'best' segmentation, we propose generating multiple segmentations based on the accurate and parsimonious delineation of scene objects.",
    "A dataset of scenes, which consists of visual representations or settings, has a broader term 'dataset', a collection of data used for statistical analysis. The scene itself can be considered as an image, with recent advances in spectral clustering being a method to group similar images together. Image matting is another approach that separates foreground objects from their backgrounds. Boundary detection is also a method used to identify the edges or limits within an image. Rather than finding a single 'best' segmentation, generating multiple segmentations can be considered as one of the methods. The dataset of scenes has a broader term 'dataset', and groups of images are another type of dataset."
