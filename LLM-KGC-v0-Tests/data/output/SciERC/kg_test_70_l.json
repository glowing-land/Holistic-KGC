  "summary": "In this paper we explore a new theory of discourse structure that stresses the role of purpose and processing in discourse . In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances -LRB- called the linguistic structure -RRB- , a structure of purposes -LRB- called the intentional structure -RRB- , and the state of focus of attention -LRB- called the attentional state -RRB- . The linguistic structure consists of segments of the discourse into which the utterances naturally aggregate . The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them . The attentional state is an abstraction of the focus of attention of the participants as the discourse unfolds . The attentional state , being dynamic , records the objects , properties , and relations that are salient at each point of the discourse . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions . The theory of attention , intention , and aggregation of utterances is illustrated in the paper with a number of example discourses . Various properties of discourse are described , and explanations for the behaviour of cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions are explored . This theory provides a framework for describing the processing of utterances in a discourse . Discourse processing requires recognizing how the utterances of the discourse aggregate into segments , recognizing the intentions expressed in the discourse and the relationships among intentions , and tracking the discourse through the operation of the mechanisms associated with attentional state . This processing description specifies in these recognition tasks the role of information from the discourse and from the participants ' knowledge of the domain .",

    "According to this new theory of discourse structure, which emphasizes the roles of purpose and processing, a discourse is composed of three interrelated components: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. This framework captures purposes expressed in each linguistic segment as well as relationships among them, essential for explaining phenomena such as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions. The theory also highlights the importance of recognizing how utterances aggregate into segments, identifying intentions expressed in a discourse, and tracking its progression through attentional state mechanisms. Furthermore, this paper explores this new theory of discourse structure, which is illustrated with a number of example discourses that demonstrate the roles of purpose and processing in shaping the organization, development, and comprehension of a discourse.",
    "According to a new theory of discourse structure, discourse can be understood as composed of three interrelated components: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state. This framework posits that purpose plays a crucial role in shaping discourse, with cues such as cue phrases, referring expressions, and interruptions influencing the focus of attention among participants. The processing of utterances in a discourse involves attending to certain aspects, forming intentions based on those stimuli, and aggregating verbal outputs. For instance, linguistic segments can express discourse-relevant purposes, while various properties of discourse describe units of language characterized by coherent sequences of words or phrases.",
    "The state of focus of attention is an abstraction that captures the salient objects, properties, and relations at each point. This mental state characterizing an individual's focus on specific information or stimuli has a broader term as discourse. The intentional structure, which has components such as purposes expressed in each linguistic segment and relationships among them, plays a part in shaping the organization, development, and comprehension of a discourse. Processing descriptions outline how utterances aggregate into segments, identifying intentions expressed in a discourse, and tracking its progression through attentional state mechanisms. A theory explaining how individuals process and respond to linguistic stimuli by attending to certain aspects, forming intentions based on those stimuli, and aggregating their verbal outputs is essential for understanding the role of purpose and processing in discourse.",
    "The linguistic structure of discourse processing can be understood as having a broader term, which are components. This framework involves attentional states that have relationships among intentions and being dynamic properties. Furthermore, theories about intention and their relationships provide an explanation for how participants focus on specific information or stimuli during the unfolding of a discourse. In this context, being dynamic is characterized by changes in the focus of attention over time to reflect relevant objects, properties, and relationships."
