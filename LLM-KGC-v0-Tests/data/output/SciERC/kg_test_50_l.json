    "In this study, we introduce Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M. This provides a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition, which has far-reaching implications for signal processing and machine learning applications. We consider the problem of estimating the approximate joint eigenstructure of a set of real, jointly diagonalizable matrices with noise level. Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M. This has broader implications for Joint matrix triangularization, which is used to estimate the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices.",
    "Matrices in M are a collection of square arrays that can be combined using linear algebra operations. This set of matrices, referred to as M of matrices, has a broader term - simply put, it's just another way to describe the same thing. Similarly, existing bounds in the literature have a broader term, which is literature itself. These relationships highlight how different concepts and collections are connected and can be understood within their respective contexts."
