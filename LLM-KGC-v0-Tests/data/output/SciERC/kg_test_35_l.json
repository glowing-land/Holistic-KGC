    "The Empirical Risk Minimization -LRB- ERM -RRB- algorithm provides a principled and provable solution for this problem, which solves specialized regression problems to obtain sampling probabilities for records in databases. This unique form of regularization is also needed for reg-ularization. The paper presents a cost zero solution that exists under hard budget constraints, excluding uniform sampling as an option. In contrast, standard stratified sampling can be used to solve standard regression problems and has broader implications for problem-solving.",
    "Aggregate queries are a type of query that involves aggregating data to produce summary statistics or other meaningful values. Queries, as broader terms, encompass aggregate queries and uniform sampling and standard stratified sampling can be seen as a principled and provable solution for addressing specific issues. Records in databases evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions by providing digital storage for relevant information."
