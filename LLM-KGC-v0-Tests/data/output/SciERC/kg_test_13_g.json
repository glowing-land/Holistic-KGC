  "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun . In Thai language , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun , both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers . Basically , there is no exact rule for classifier selection . As far as we can do in the rule-based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun . Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types are open due to the meaning of representation . We propose a corpus-based method -LRB- Biber ,1993 ; Nagao ,1993 ; Smadja ,1993 -RRB- which generates Noun Classifier Associations -LRB- NCA -RRB- to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase . The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences .",

    "This paper describes classifier assignment, which generates Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) through a method that utilizes a large corpus. The Noun Classifier Associations are created from this corpus and are recomposed under the frequency of occurrences and concept hierarchy constraints. Additionally, the paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun, which is influenced by individual speakers and the variability in classifier selection. A corresponding classifier, which corresponds to each noun, is determined by a default rule that picks up the appropriate classifier. The Registration of classifier is limited to a type of unit classifier, which is a broader term under the classifier category. Overall, the Noun Classifier Associations help overcome the challenges posed by the semantic construction of noun phrases in the Thai language.",
    "The corpus-based method generates Noun Classifier Associations, which are essential for understanding the selection of classifiers in the Thai language. A rule-based approach gives rise to a default rule that aids in classifier selection when no specific rule applies. Classifiers, which categorize nouns based on their semantic properties, have a broader term known as algorithms, including an algorithm specifically designed for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun. This algorithm is crucial for each noun, which is a broader category encompassing all nouns. The meaning of representation, which influences the choice of classifiers, has a broader term called representation. Additionally, classifiers fluctuate in choice for concrete nouns, while a large corpus serves as a broader term for the structured collection of texts used in this analysis. The speech community plays a significant role in influencing classifier usage, and other types of classifiers are open due to the flexibility provided by the meaning of representation. Finally, concept hierarchy constraints, which organize classifier associations, have a broader term known as concept hierarchy."
