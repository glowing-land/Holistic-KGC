    "This paper proposes extending to a context-dependent one, which generates fundamental frequency (F0) contours based on text inputs. The Fujisaki model has allowed us to derive an efficient algorithm for estimating the Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours. This statistical speech synthesis model is described by a broader term, 'a statistical model describing the generating process of speech F0 contours'. Moreover, this paper deals with problem and proposes extending it to a context-dependent one.",
    "The parameter training algorithm has a broader term, which is an algorithm. This method or procedure used to adjust and refine parameters in order to optimize their performance can be applied more generally as a set of instructions that solves a specific problem or performs a particular task in a computational manner. Meanwhile, the paper deals with a problem, presenting research or scholarly findings on how to overcome this difficulty."
