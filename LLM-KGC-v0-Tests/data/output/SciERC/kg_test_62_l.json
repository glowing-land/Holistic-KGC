    "The process of evaluating machine translation systems, also known as -LRB- MT -RRB- evaluation, are able to produce useful features for paraphrase classification and entailment. Standard MT evaluation methods apply this technique, which produces useful features for paraphrase classification. Our novel method leverages part-of-speech information to improve paraphrase classification accuracy, outperforming all other models used in the experiments. This task is closely related to sentence-level semantic equivalence classification, as well as building classifiers to predict semantic equivalence and entailment. We also introduce a novel classification method based on PER which leverages part of speech information of the words contributing to word matches and non-matches in the sentence."
