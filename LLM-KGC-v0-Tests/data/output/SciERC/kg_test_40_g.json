    "Classifiers' performances, which refer to the effectiveness of machine learning models, have a broader term known as classifiers. Both classifiers, specifically the Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers, are utilized in the task of addressee identification, which aims to determine the intended recipient of dialogue acts in four-participant face-to-face meetings. The performances of these classifiers can be enhanced by incorporating speaker's gaze information, which serves as a nonverbal cue, and they show significant gains when combined with various features such as utterance features and conversational context. Additionally, information about meeting context can aid classifiers' performances, although it has been noted that both classifiers show little gain from this information. The addressee can be predicted based on gaze, conversational context features, and the overall conversational context, highlighting the importance of these elements in the classification process.",
    "In the context of communication, the addressee can be predicted based on the utterance made during a dialogue. Furthermore, the addressee is a specific type of dialogue act, indicating that it falls under a broader category of communicative actions. Similarly, the utterance itself also has a broader term, which is the dialogue act, highlighting its role as a unit of communication within conversations."
