    "Synchronous TAGs, which are a variant of tree-adjoining grammars, have a broader term that includes TAG and formalism. They are designed to characterize correspondences between languages, highlighting the relationships that exist between different natural languages. In the context of synchronous TAGs, computational issues arise in their interpretation, which is a broader term encompassing the process of deriving meaning from natural language expressions. The formalism of synchronous TAGs relates to the process of translating expressions into another natural language, as well as to logical form language, which serves to connect syntactic structures with their meanings. Furthermore, synchronous TAGs are applied to concrete examples, illustrating their practical use beyond traditional syntax proper. Overall, the formalism also relates to semantics, emphasizing the importance of meaning in the study of languages.",
    "Automatic translation involves the use of natural language, as it requires the conversion of text or speech from one language to another without human intervention. Additionally, semantic interpretation, which is crucial for understanding the meaning of linguistic expressions, has a broader term known as semantics, the study of meaning in natural languages."
