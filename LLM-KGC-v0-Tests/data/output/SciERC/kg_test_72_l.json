    "Criteria for anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries rephrase major concepts from GB's binding theory. This broader framework, which has a unified account of both sentence-level and text-level anaphora, incorporates those for text-level anaphora that adapt Grosz-Sidner-style focus models. We provide this comprehensive explanation using the dependency-based grammar model."
