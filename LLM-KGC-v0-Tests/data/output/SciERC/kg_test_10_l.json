    "This formalism controls The polarization. TAG and rewriting systems simulate This formalism, which has a broader term of formalism. HPSG and LFG also simulate this formalism. Dependency grammars are simulated by This formalism as well. Additionally, generic mathematical formalisms propose products of strings, trees, dags, graphs, and their combinations. Furthermore, TAG is simulated by the proposed generic mathematical formalism, which combines various structures such as strings, trees, dags, graphs, and their products.",
    "The linguistic theory HPSG formalizes grammar using categorial semantics and type-logical structures. It falls under the broader category of formalism, which uses rules to describe language structure. Another linguistic theory, LFG, also operates within this framework. Additionally, dependency grammars can be seen as a specific instance of formalism. Furthermore, objects are composed of fundamental building blocks called objects of elementary structures."
