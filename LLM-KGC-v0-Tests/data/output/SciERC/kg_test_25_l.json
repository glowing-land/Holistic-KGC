    "The impossibility theorem states that there exists no clustering function satisfying all three simple properties. This formal perspective suggests a difficulty in finding such unification, which abounds in the research community with profoundly diverse approaches to clustering. Clustering methods like k-means and single-linkage have broader terms encompassing their applications, including study of clustering centered around an intuitively compelling goal."
