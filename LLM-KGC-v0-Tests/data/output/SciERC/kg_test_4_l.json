    "The LCS- Marine system enables tactical personnel to converse with their logistics systems using spoken language, allowing them to place supply or information requests and receive notifications on request status. This capability has been demonstrated through several field exercises with the Marines. The system integrates a spoken language understanding system with intelligent mobile agents, enabling users to interactively communicate with their logistics systems. Requestors can instruct the system to notify them of status updates, making it an effective tool for mediating between users and information sources.",
    "A spoken language understanding system, which is a technology designed to comprehend spoken languages, has a broader term of 'system', a software-based or computer-controlled entity that performs specific tasks. Users and information sources, who are individuals interacting with various data providers or databases, also have a broader term of 'users'. A mobile, an autonomous software entity that executes requests and provides notifications on behalf of users in an information system, has a broader term of 'mobile', which is a portable electronic device providing access to communication and computing services. The spoken language understanding system uses the appropriate database for execution at, which is a repository or system storing data in support of executing user requests. Furthermore, technology, including mobile devices, has a broader term of 'system'."
