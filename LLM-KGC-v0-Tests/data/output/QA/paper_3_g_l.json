    "question": "Why was MILIS Linux chosen as the operating system base for this project?",
    "answer": "MILIS Linux was chosen because it is an open-source operating system development project with an independent user space and its own package manager. It differs from other GNU/Linux projects by not being based on any existing Linux distribution and provides a pure Linux usage and development experience. The project aims to work on open-source hardware and be one of the first among Linux distributions to support RISC-V, aligning with the goal of creating a completely independent open-source computing system.",
    "LLM_answer": "MILIS Linux was chosen as the operating system base for this project because it is an open-source operating system development project that started in 2016, is implemented using LFS (Linux from Scratch), and is designed to run smoothly on 64-bit systems, making it suitable for the RISC-V architecture.",

    "question": "What challenges are associated with booting the Linux kernel on RISC-V, and how does the Berkeley Bootloader (BBL) address them?",
    "answer": "One challenge is that RISC-V lacks a traditional bootloader like GRUB or U-Boot that can chainload a Linux kernel. The Berkeley Bootloader (BBL) addresses this by linking the kernel binary directly into the BBL ELF file during the compile process. BBL supports starting and responding to timer interrupts, boot chain loading for Linux, and handles certain instructions that the RISC-V processor cannot execute directly in hardware.",
    "LLM_answer": "Booting the Linux kernel on RISC-V presents several challenges, including the fact that RISC-V processors are not equipped to handle some instructions directly in hardware. The Berkeley Bootloader (BBL) addresses these challenges by linking the kernel binary and utilizing the '-withpayload config parameter' to compile and reference the compiled kernel during the building process. Additionally, BBL must always be rebuilt within the kernel, which helps ensure compatibility and functionality.",

    "LLM_answer": "The key components involved in porting MILIS Linux to the RISC-V architecture include developing kernel and userspace packages, building toolchains, creating bootloaders, and producing pre-root file systems. These components are part of the work packages that are typically included in the porting process.",

    "question": "How does the open-source nature of RISC-V contribute to improved security, according to the paper?",
    "answer": "The open-source nature of RISC-V allows for the ISA to be discovered and improved by industry experts, commercial innovators, and academics. This openness facilitates the application of qualified security ideas and enables the community to address vulnerabilities more effectively. Additionally, because RISC-V lacks speculative memory access, it is inherently immune to hardware weaknesses like the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, enhancing security.",
    "LLM_answer": "The open-source nature of RISC-V contributes to improved security by allowing for greater transparency and community collaboration in the development of the architecture. This openness enables developers to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities more effectively than in proprietary systems, where the source code is not available for scrutiny. Additionally, the ability to customize and extend the RISC-V architecture allows for the implementation of specific security features tailored to various applications, enhancing overall system security.",

    "question": "What is the significance of RISC-V's lack of speculative memory access in the context of Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities?",
    "answer": "The lack of speculative memory access in RISC-V means that it does not perform the speculative execution that led to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities in other processors. As a result, RISC-V processors are inherently immune to these specific hardware vulnerabilities, which enhances the security of systems based on RISC-V architecture.",
    "LLM_answer": "The significance of RISC-V's lack of speculative memory access lies in its potential to mitigate vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre. These vulnerabilities exploit speculative execution, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information. By not implementing speculative memory access, RISC-V reduces the attack surface for such vulnerabilities, making it a more secure architecture compared to others that do allow speculative execution.",

    "question": "According to the paper, why have previous open-source hardware projects like OpenRISC and OpenSPARC been insufficient in creating a large open-source ecosystem?",
    "answer": "Previous open-source hardware projects like OpenRISC and OpenSPARC have been insufficient because they lacked the necessary support and failed to gain widespread adoption. OpenRISC's development slowed over time, and projects like Debian dropped support due to reasons such as copyright issues. These projects did not attract enough attention or contributions to create a significant open-source ecosystem.",
    "LLM_answer": "Previous open-source hardware projects like OpenRISC and OpenSPARC have been insufficient in creating a large open-source ecosystem because their work has been limited to few distributions, which restricts the development and adoption of open-source hardware. Additionally, while these projects are based on community-driven design, the lack of widespread support and collaboration has hindered the growth of a robust ecosystem.",
