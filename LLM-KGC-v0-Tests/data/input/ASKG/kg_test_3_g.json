  "summary": "Abstract\u2014As is commonly known, hardware in a computer system requires a processor to run the operating system. The primary architectures that form the basis of most processors are CISC and RISC. CISC includes long sub-level commands for effective memory management and simple compiler implementations to be developed. Thus CISC has a complex set of commands; hence the name Complex Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, CISC has had backward compatibility since the 1970s. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), the other popular architecture, simplifies command sets and handles access to memory with load-store commands. Since the instruction set is simplified, the hardware runs faster. In addition, RISC-based processors contain less chip-sets and may be designed faster. Currently, with the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for RISC architectures has increased and its usage in embedded devices has become widespread. The ARM processor is a successful example of the RISC architecture adaptation. However, ARM processor production has certain license term limitations and contains a few design flaws in its architecture [1]. In 2010, the RISC-V processor architecture, which was developed as an open source instruction set at Berkeley University, paves the way for open source hardware in terms of its BSD license and design professionalism. As a result, it will be possible to produce their own processors for communities and organizations without license restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the building blocks of the development life-cycle of an open source operating system on the RISC-V architecture. As an operating system base, we implement MILIS Linux, an open source operating system development project. It has an independent user space and its own package manager. For a completely independent open source computing system, open source RISC-V hardware architecture provides the freedom that is needed.\n\nRISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that offers a more homogeneous set of instructions compared to CISC, optimizing execution and minimizing memory usage. It addresses vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre by promoting hardware-level security and open-source collaboration. The RISC-V foundation includes contributions from various global institutions, and its architecture supports a wide range of applications. MILIS Linux, initiated in 2016, is an independent Linux distribution aimed at providing a user-friendly operating system, particularly for government and commercial use. It is not based on existing distributions and aims to create an open-source ecosystem. The MILIS project is now developing a fork to support RISC-V architecture, targeting embedded devices and IoT applications, with the goal of being among the first open-source Linux OS for RISC-V.\n\nSiFive has developed several motherboards for RISC-V processors, leading to increased support for Linux distributions. Legacy distributions like Debian are porting to RISC-V, while Fedora is creating a native OS and tracking compilation online. Buildroot has also been adapted for 64-bit RISC-V, supporting both native and original implementations. This paper focuses on enhancing kernel support and reducing porting times through a reference implementation based on MILIS, aiming to build a Linux from Scratch and improve user-space applications.\n\nMILIS Linux is successfully running on 64-bit systems, focusing on RISC-V architecture. The project aims to create kernel and userspace packages for a 64-bit little-endian RISC-V system, with future considerations for 32-bit and 128-bit configurations. Key components include: A. System Emulation using QEMU for development without hardware; B. Toolchain with GCC 9.1 and Binutils 2.32, utilizing Glibc 2.29 for RISC-V support; C. Bootloader options like Berkley Bootloader (BBL) for kernel execution, which requires rebuilding with the kernel; D. Ongoing work on the Linux kernel and userspace, including init code, device handling, and user APIs; E. Pre-Root File System creation through cross-compilation for a bootable OS; F. Bootable Image production from MILIS packages for distribution. The RISC-V Linux port is included in the Linux tree since 2017, marking significant progress.\n\nThis paper discusses the RISC-V processor, highlighting its open-source, community-driven design and potential for mission-critical applications, especially in the Internet of Things. With many companies investing in R&D for RISC-V and joining the RISC-V foundation, its market popularity is expected to rise. The paper emphasizes the need for a reliable open-source operating system, proposing Linux as the ideal kernel. While port migration of Linux distributions is underway, the focus is on developing a robust user ecosystem on the Linux kernel through the MILIS Linux project. This initiative aims to enhance IT processes and will benefit from the open computing proposal.\n\nA. Physical Implementation and Optimizations The work outline performed on the QEMU virtual machine discussed in this study will be applied on a real board based on RISC-V processor. Compilation and testing will give more accurate results using physical hardware. Thus, we will have a better understanding of the components that will need to be optimized. The compilation tools that we use in the bootstrap process will offer more RISC-V support over time and will be optimized. In addition, alternative libraries instead of Glibc, which we currently use as C libraries, will be evaluated. Also, with the RISC-V support in the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure [31], native compile support will be increased at the level of programming languages which use LLVM as back-end compiler. RISC-V porting will be further explored for the kernel level difficulties encountered while providing the necessary solutions. The necessary sponsors and research project funding supports will be provided for the R&D studies and RISC-V processors with different features will be obtained and the studies will be performed on real equipment.\n\nB. The Future: Open Hardware and Open Source Operating System Open hardware means license-free; namely with RISC-V virtually anyone can produce potentially better evaluations and much more accurate comparisons with existing works. There is a range of high quality, open-source RISC-V implementations to modify, rather than just based on estimating or simulations. Also opening standard will bring about a more active development community so that when sharing patches or ideas, projects will get contributions more quickly. As of now one aspect of the RISC-V Foundation is responding to proposals and discussing them. The other aspect is producing proposed changes either in a future specification revision or in hardware. On the other hand, opening the standards and having a commercially open license would certainly make the processor design and production race more fair. Also RISC-V will bring a new synergy of open source computer architecture research areas, such as universities started to establish research groups on RISC-V, such as OpenCelerity [32] and SCARV [33]. Research is expected to be carried out on real hardware with the increase of RISC-V processor manufacturers. As a result, Linux kernel and userspace seems the best candidate software stack for RISC-V.",
