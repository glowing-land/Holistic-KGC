  "summary": "Abstract\u2014As is commonly known, hardware in a computer system requires a processor to run the operating system. The primary architectures that form the basis of most processors are CISC and RISC. CISC includes long sub-level commands for effective memory management and simple compiler implementations to be developed. Thus CISC has a complex set of commands; hence the name Complex Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, CISC has had backward compatibility since the 1970s. Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), the other popular architecture, simplifies command sets and handles access to memory with load-store commands. Since the instruction set is simplified, the hardware runs faster. In addition, RISC-based processors contain less chip-sets and may be designed faster. Currently, with the prevalence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the demand for RISC architectures has increased and its usage in embedded devices has become widespread. The ARM processor is a successful example of the RISC architecture adaptation. However, ARM processor production has certain license term limitations and contains a few design flaws in its architecture [1]. In 2010, the RISC-V processor architecture, which was developed as an open source instruction set at Berkeley University, paves the way for open source hardware in terms of its BSD license and design professionalism. As a result, it will be possible to produce their own processors for communities and organizations without license restrictions. In this paper, we discuss the building blocks of the development life-cycle of an open source operating system on the RISC-V architecture. As an operating system base, we implement MILIS Linux, an open source operating system development project. It has an independent user space and its own package manager. For a completely independent open source computing system, open source RISC-V hardware architecture provides the freedom that is needed.\n\nRISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) designed to be more secure and efficient than traditional ISAs like CISC. It's free, open-source, and has gained support from many companies and institutions worldwide. The RISC-V ISA aims to provide a more secure architecture by eliminating speculative memory access, making it immune to vulnerabilities like Meltdown-Spectre. To achieve this goal, the MILIS Linux project is being developed as a fork of the original MILIS project to support RISC-V architecture.\n\nSi-five has produced development motherboards for RISC-V processors, leading to momentum with Linux distributions like Debian and Fedora. These distros have ported their infrastructure to RISC-V, while Buildroot supports both native and original implementations on this architecture.\n\nThe MILIS Linux project aims to port a 64-bit little-endian RISC-V compatible base system, with support for 32- and 128-bit ISA configurations. The project uses QEMU virtual machine, GCC 9.1, Binutils 2.32, Glibc 2.29, and Berkley Bootloader (BBL) to build the kernel and userspace packages. RISC-V Linux port has been accepted into the Linux tree and is slated for release as part of version 4.15 since 2017.\n\nThe RISC-V processor has been compared to other architectures, highlighting its potential for use in mission-critical projects due to its open-source and community-driven design. The paper emphasizes the need for an open-source operating system, with Linux being a suitable candidate as the kernel.\n\nA. Physical Implementation and Optimizations The work outline performed on the QEMU virtual machine discussed in this study will be applied on a real board based on RISC-V processor. Compilation and testing will give more accurate results using physical hardware. Thus, we will have a better understanding of the components that will need to be optimized. The compilation tools that we use in the bootstrap process will offer more RISC-V support over time and will be optimized. In addition, alternative libraries instead of Glibc, which we currently use as C libraries, will be evaluated. Also, with the RISC-V support in the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure [31], native compile support will be increased at the level of programming languages which use LLVM as back-end compiler. RISC-V porting will be further explored for the kernel level difficulties encountered while providing the necessary solutions. The necessary sponsors and research project funding supports will be provided for the R&D studies and RISC-V processors with different features will be obtained and the studies will be performed on real equipment.\n\nB. The Future: Open Hardware and Open Source Operating System Open hardware means license-free; namely with RISC-V virtually anyone can produce potentially better evaluations and much more accurate comparisons with existing works. There is a range of high quality, open-source RISC-V implementations to modify, rather than just based on estimating or simulations. Also opening standard will bring about a more active development community so that when sharing patches or ideas, projects will get contributions more quickly. As of now one aspect of the RISC-V Foundation is responding to proposals and discussing them. The other aspect is producing proposed changes either in a future specification revision or in hardware. On the other hand, opening the standards and having a commercially open license would certainly make the processor design and production race more fair. Also RISC-V will bring a new synergy of open source computer architecture research areas, such as universities started to establish research groups on RISC-V, such as OpenCelerity [32] and SCARV [33]. Research is expected to be carried out on real hardware with the increase of RISC-V processor manufacturers. As a result, Linux kernel and userspace seems the best candidate software stack for RISC-V.",
