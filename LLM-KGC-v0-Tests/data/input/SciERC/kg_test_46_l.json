  "summary": "This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the motion of a 3D articulated tree from 2D point correspondences subject to some temporal prior . Hitherto , smooth motion has been encouraged using a trajectory basis , yielding a hard combinatorial problem with time complexity growing exponentially in the number of frames . Branch and bound strategies have previously attempted to curb this complexity whilst maintaining global optimality . However , they provide no guarantee of being more efficient than exhaustive search . Inspired by recent work which reconstructs general trajectories using compact high-pass filters , we develop a dynamic programming approach which scales linearly in the number of frames , leveraging the intrinsically local nature of filter interactions . Extension to affine projection enables reconstruction without estimating cameras .",
