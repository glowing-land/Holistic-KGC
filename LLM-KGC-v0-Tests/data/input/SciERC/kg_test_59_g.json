  "summary": "The applicability of many current information extraction techniques is severely limited by the need for supervised training data . We demonstrate that for certain field structured extraction tasks , such as classified advertisements and bibliographic citations , small amounts of prior knowledge can be used to learn effective models in a primarily unsupervised fashion . Although hidden Markov models -LRB- HMMs -RRB- provide a suitable generative model for field structured text , general unsupervised HMM learning fails to learn useful structure in either of our domains . However , one can dramatically improve the quality of the learned structure by exploiting simple prior knowledge of the desired solutions . In both domains , we found that unsupervised methods can attain accuracies with 400 unlabeled examples comparable to those attained by supervised methods on 50 labeled examples , and that semi-supervised methods can make good use of small amounts of labeled data .",
