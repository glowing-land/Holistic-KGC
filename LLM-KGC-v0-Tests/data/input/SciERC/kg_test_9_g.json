It works by calculating eigenvectors of an adjacency graph 's Laplacian to recover a submanifold of data from a high dimensionality space and then performing cluster number estimation on the eigenvectors . Experiment results on ACE corpora show that this spectral clustering based approach outperforms the other clustering methods .",
