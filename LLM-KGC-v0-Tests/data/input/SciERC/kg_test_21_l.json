  "summary": "This paper proposes to use a convolution kernel over parse trees to model syntactic structure information for relation extraction . Our study reveals that the syntactic structure features embedded in a parse tree are very effective for relation extraction and these features can be well captured by the convolution tree kernel . Evaluation on the ACE 2003 corpus shows that the convolution kernel over parse trees can achieve comparable performance with the previous best-reported feature-based methods on the 24 ACE relation subtypes . It also shows that our method significantly outperforms the previous two dependency tree kernels on the 5 ACE relation major types .",
