  "summary": "MINPRAN , a new robust operator , nds good ts in data sets where more than 50 % of the points are outliers . Unlike other techniques that handle large outlier percentages , MINPRAN does not rely on a known error bound for the good data . Instead it assumes that the bad data are randomly -LRB- uniformly -RRB- distributed within the dynamic range of the sensor . Based on this , MINPRAN uses random sampling to search for the t and the number of inliers to the t that are least likely to have occurred randomly . It runs in time O -LRB- N 2 + SN log N -RRB- , where S is the number of random samples and N is the number of data points . We demonstrate analytically that MINPRAN distinguishes good ts from ts to random data , and that MINPRAN nds accurate ts and nearly the correct number of inliers , regardless of the percentage of true inliers . MINPRAN 's properties are connrmed experimentally on synthetic data and compare favorably to least median of squares . Related work applies MINPRAN to complex range and intensity data 23 -RSB- .",
