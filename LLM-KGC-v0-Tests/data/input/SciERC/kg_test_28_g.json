  "summary": "This paper describes a novel system for acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames -LRB- scfs -RRB- and associated frequency information from English corpus data . The system incorporates a decision-tree classifier for 30 scf types which tests for the presence of grammatical relations -LRB- grs -RRB- in the output of a robust statistical parser . It uses a powerful pattern-matching language to classify grs into frames hierarchically in a way that mirrors inheritance-based lexica . The experiments show that the system is able to detect scf types with 70 % precision and 66 % recall rate . A new tool for linguistic annotation of scfs in corpus data is also introduced which can considerably alleviate the process of obtaining training and test data for subcategorization acquisition .",
