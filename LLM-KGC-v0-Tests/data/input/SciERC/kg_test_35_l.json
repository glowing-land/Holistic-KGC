  "summary": "This paper solves a specialized regression problem to obtain sampling probabilities for records in databases . The goal is to sample a small set of records over which evaluating aggregate queries can be done both efficiently and accurately . We provide a principled and provable solution for this problem ; it is parameterless and requires no data insights . Unlike standard regression problems , the loss is inversely proportional to the regressed-to values . Moreover , a cost zero solution always exists and can only be excluded by hard budget constraints . A unique form of reg-ularization is also needed . We provide an efficient and simple regularized Empirical Risk Minimization -LRB- ERM -RRB- algorithm along with a theoretical generalization result . Our extensive experimental results significantly improve over both uniform sampling and standard stratified sampling which are de-facto the industry standards .",
