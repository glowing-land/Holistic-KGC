  "summary": "This poster paper describes a full scale two-level morphological description -LRB- Karttunen , 1983 ; Koskenniemi , 1983 -RRB- of Turkish word structures . The description has been implemented using the PC-KIMMO environment -LRB- Antworth , 1990 -RRB- and is based on a root word lexicon of about 23,000 roots words . Almost all the special cases of and exceptions to phonological and morphological rules have been implemented . Turkish is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by productive affixations of derivational and inflectional suffixes to root words . Turkish has finite-state but nevertheless rather complex morphotactics . Morphemes added to a root word or a stem can convert the word from a nominal to a verbal structure or vice-versa , or can create adverbial constructs . The surface realizations of morphological constructions are constrained and modified by a number of phonetic rules such as vowel harmony .",
