  "summary": "Coedition of a natural language text and its representation in some interlingual form seems the best and simplest way to share text revision across languages . For various reasons , UNL graphs are the best candidates in this context . We are developing a prototype where , in the simplest sharing scenario , naive users interact directly with the text in their language -LRB- L0 -RRB- , and indirectly with the associated graph . The modified graph is then sent to the UNL-L0 deconverter and the result shown . If is is satisfactory , the errors were probably due to the graph , not to the deconverter , and the graph is sent to deconverters in other languages . Versions in some other languages known by the user may be displayed , so that improvement sharing is visible and encouraging . As new versions are added with appropriate tags and attributes in the original multilingual document , nothing is ever lost , and cooperative working on a document is rendered feasible . On the internal side , liaisons are established between elements of the text and the graph by using broadly available resources such as a LO-English or better a L0-UNL dictionary , a morphosyntactic parser of L0 , and a canonical graph2tree transformation . Establishing a `` best '' correspondence between the '' UNL-tree + L0 '' and the '' MS-L0 structure '' , a lattice , may be done using the dictionary and trying to align the tree and the selected trajectory with as few crossing liaisons as possible . A central goal of this research is to merge approaches from pivot MT , interactive MT , and multilingual text authoring .",
