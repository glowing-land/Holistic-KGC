  "summary": "We present a new part-of-speech tagger that demonstrates the following ideas : -LRB- i -RRB- explicit use of both preceding and following tag contexts via a dependency network representation , -LRB- ii -RRB- broad use of lexical features , including jointly conditioning on multiple consecutive words , -LRB- iii -RRB- effective use of priors in conditional loglinear models , and -LRB- iv -RRB- fine-grained modeling of unknown word features . Using these ideas together , the resulting tagger gives a 97.24 % accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ , an error reduction of 4.4 % on the best previous single automatically learned tagging result .",
