  "summary": "We present a new method for detecting interest points using histogram information . Unlike existing interest point detectors , which measure pixel-wise differences in image intensity , our detectors incorporate histogram-based representations , and thus can find image regions that present a distinct distribution in the neighborhood . The proposed detectors are able to capture large-scale structures and distinctive textured patterns , and exhibit strong invariance to rotation , illumination variation , and blur . The experimental results show that the proposed histogram-based interest point detectors perform particularly well for the tasks of matching textured scenes under blur and illumination changes , in terms of repeatability and distinctiveness . An extension of our method to space-time interest point detection for action classification is also presented .",
