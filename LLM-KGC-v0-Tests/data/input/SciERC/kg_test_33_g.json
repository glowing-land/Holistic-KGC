  "summary": "Sentence boundary detection in speech is important for enriching speech recognition output , making it easier for humans to read and downstream modules to process . In previous work , we have developed hidden Markov model -LRB- HMM -RRB- and maximum entropy -LRB- Maxent -RRB- classifiers that integrate textual and prosodic knowledge sources for detecting sentence boundaries . In this paper , we evaluate the use of a conditional random field -LRB- CRF -RRB- for this task and relate results with this model to our prior work . We evaluate across two corpora -LRB- conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech -RRB- on both human transcriptions and speech recognition output . In general , our CRF model yields a lower error rate than the HMM and Max-ent models on the NIST sentence boundary detection task in speech , although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by three-way voting among the classifiers . This probably occurs because each model has different strengths and weaknesses for modeling the knowledge sources .",
