  "summary": "While sentence extraction as an approach to summarization has been shown to work in documents of certain genres , because of the conversational nature of email communication where utterances are made in relation to one made previously , sentence extraction may not capture the necessary segments of dialogue that would make a summary coherent . In this paper , we present our work on the detection of question-answer pairs in an email conversation for the task of email summarization . We show that various features based on the structure of email-threads can be used to improve upon lexical similarity of discourse segments for question-answer pairing .",
