We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings , word-to-word alignments from an MT system , and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences . We report the performance of the MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English translation task . Our results show that MBR decoding can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions .",
