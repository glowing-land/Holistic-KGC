  "summary": "Recognition of proper nouns in Japanese text has been studied as a part of the more general problem of morphological analysis in Japanese text processing -LRB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 2 -RSB- -RRB- . It has also been studied in the framework of Japanese information extraction -LRB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- -RRB- in recent years . Our approach to the Multi-lingual Evaluation Task -LRB- MET -RRB- for Japanese text is to consider the given task as a morphological analysis problem in Japanese . Our morphological analyzer has done all the necessary work for the recognition and classification of proper names , numerical and temporal expressions , i.e. Named Entity -LRB- NE -RRB- items in the Japanese text . The analyzer is called `` Amorph '' . Amorph recognizes NE items in two stages : dictionary lookup and rule application . First , it uses several kinds of dictionaries to segment and tag Japanese character strings . Second , based on the information resulting from the dictionary lookup stage , a set of rules is applied to the segmented strings in order to identify NE items . When a segment is found to be an NE item , this information is added to the segment and it is used to generate the final output .",
