  "summary": "In the study of expressive speech communication , it is commonly accepted that the emotion perceived by the listener is a good approximation of the intended emotion conveyed by the speaker . This paper analyzes the validity of this assumption by comparing the mismatches between the assessments made by na \u00a8 \u0131ve listeners and by the speakers that generated the data . The analysis is based on the hypothesis that people are better decoders of their own emotions . Therefore , self-assessments will be closer to the intended emotions . Using the IEMOCAP database , discrete -LRB- categorical -RRB- and continuous -LRB- attribute -RRB- emotional assessments evaluated by the actors and na \u00a8 \u0131ve listeners are compared . The results indicate that there is a mismatch between the expression and perception of emotion . The speakers in the database assigned their own emotions to more specific emotional categories , which led to more extreme values in the activation-valence space .",
