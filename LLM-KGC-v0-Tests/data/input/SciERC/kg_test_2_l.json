  "summary": "We propose to incorporate a priori geometric constraints in a 3 -- D stereo reconstruction scheme to cope with the many cases where image information alone is not sufficient to accurately recover 3 -- D shape . Our approach is based on the iterative deformation of a 3 -- D surface mesh to minimize an objective function . We show that combining anisotropic meshing with a non-quadratic approach to regularization enables us to obtain satisfactory reconstruction results using triangulations with few vertices . Structural or numerical constraints can then be added locally to the reconstruction process through a constrained optimization scheme . They improve the reconstruction results and enforce their consistency with a priori knowledge about object shape . The strong description and modeling properties of differential features make them useful tools that can be efficiently used as constraints for 3 -- D reconstruction .",
