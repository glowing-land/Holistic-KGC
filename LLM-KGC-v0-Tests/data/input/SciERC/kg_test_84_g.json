  "summary": "Light fields are image-based representations that use densely sampled rays as a scene description . In this paper , we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching . The triangulation problem aims to fill in the ray space with continuous and non-overlapping simplices anchored at sampled points -LRB- rays -RRB- . Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field super-resolution . We show that the light field space is largely bi-linear due to 3D line segments in the scene , and direct tri-angulation of these bilinear subspaces leads to large errors . We instead present a simple but effective algorithm to first map bilinear subspaces to line constraints and then apply Constrained Delaunay Triangulation -LRB- CDT -RRB- . Based on our analysis , we further develop a novel line-assisted graph-cut -LRB- LAGC -RRB- algorithm that effectively encodes 3D line constraints into light field stereo matching . Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality .",
