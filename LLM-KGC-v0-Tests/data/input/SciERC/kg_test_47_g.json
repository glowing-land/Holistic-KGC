To improve topical blog post retrieval we incorporate textual credibility indicators in the retrieval process . We consider two groups of indicators : post level -LRB- determined using information about individual blog posts only -RRB- and blog level -LRB- determined using information from the underlying blogs -RRB- . We describe how to estimate these indicators and how to integrate them into a retrieval approach based on language models . Experiments on the TREC Blog track test set show that both groups of credibility indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness ; the best performance is achieved when combining them .",
