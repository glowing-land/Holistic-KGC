  "summary": "In this paper we discuss object detection when only a small number of training examples are given . Specifically , we show how to incorporate a simple prior on the distribution of natural images into support vector machines . SVMs are known to be robust to overfitting ; however , a few training examples usually do not represent well the structure of the class . Thus the resulting detectors are not robust and highly depend on the choice of the training examples . We incorporate the prior on natural images by requiring that the separating hyperplane will not only yield a wide margin , but also that the corresponding positive half space will have a low probability to contain natural images -LRB- the background -RRB- . Our experiments on real data sets show that the resulting detector is more robust to the choice of training examples , and substantially improves both linear and kernel SVM when trained on 10 positive and 10 negative examples .",
