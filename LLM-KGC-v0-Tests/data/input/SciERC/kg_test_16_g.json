  "summary": "We present an application of ambiguity packing and stochastic disambiguation techniques for Lexical-Functional Grammars -LRB- LFG -RRB- to the domain of sentence condensation . Our system incorporates a linguistic parser/generator for LFG , a transfer component for parse reduction operating on packed parse forests , and a maximum-entropy model for stochastic output selection . Furthermore , we propose the use of standard parser evaluation methods for automatically evaluating the summarization quality of sentence condensation systems . An experimental evaluation of summarization quality shows a close correlation between the automatic parse-based evaluation and a manual evaluation of generated strings . Overall summarization quality of the proposed system is state-of-the-art , with guaranteed grammaticality of the system output due to the use of a constraint-based parser/generator .",
