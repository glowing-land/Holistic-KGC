  "summary": "We have implemented a restricted domain parser called Plume . Building on previous work at Carnegie-Mellon University e.g. -LSB- 4 , 5 , 8 -RSB- , Plume 's approach to parsing is based on semantic caseframe instantiation . This has the advantages of efficiency on grammatical input , and robustness in the face of ungrammatical input . While Plume is well adapted to simple declarative and imperative utterances , it handles passives , relative clauses and interrogatives in an ad hoc manner leading to patchy syntactic coverage . This paper outlines Plume as it currently exists and describes our detailed design for extending Plume to handle passives , relative clauses , and interrogatives in a general manner .",
