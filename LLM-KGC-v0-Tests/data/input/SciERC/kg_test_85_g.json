A method for producing such phrases from a word-aligned corpora is proposed . A statistical translation model is also presented that deals such phrases , as well as a training method based on the maximization of translation accuracy , as measured with the NIST evaluation metric . Translations are produced by means of a beam-search decoder . Experimental results are presented , that demonstrate how the proposed method allows to better generalize from the training data .",
