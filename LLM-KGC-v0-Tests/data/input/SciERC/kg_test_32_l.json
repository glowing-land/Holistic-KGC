We analyzed eye gaze , head nods and attentional focus in the context of a direction-giving task . The distribution of nonverbal behaviors differed depending on the type of dialogue move being grounded , and the overall pattern reflected a monitoring of lack of negative feedback . Based on these results , we present an ECA that uses verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to update dialogue state .",
