  "summary": "A model-based approach to on-line cursive handwriting analysis and recognition is presented and evaluated . In this model , on-line handwriting is considered as a modulation of a simple cycloidal pen motion , described by two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of the writing . By slow modulations of the amplitudes and phase lags of the two oscillators , a general pen trajectory can be efficiently encoded . These parameters are then quantized into a small number of values without altering the writing intelligibility . A general procedure for the estimation and quantization of these cycloidal motion parameters for arbitrary handwriting is presented . The result is a discrete motor control representation of the continuous pen motion , via the quantized levels of the model parameters . This motor control representation enables successful word spotting and matching of cursive scripts . Our experiments clearly indicate the potential of this dynamic representation for complete cursive handwriting recognition .",
