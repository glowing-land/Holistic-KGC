  "summary": "A mixed-signal paradigm is presented for high-resolution parallel inner-product computation in very high dimensions , suitable for efficient implementation of kernels in image processing . At the core of the externally digital architecture is a high-density , low-power analog array performing binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication . Full digital resolution is maintained even with low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion , owing to random statistics in the analog summation of binary products . A random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics even for highly correlated inputs . The approach is validated with real image data , and with experimental results from a CID/DRAM analog array prototype in 0.5 cents m CMOS .",
