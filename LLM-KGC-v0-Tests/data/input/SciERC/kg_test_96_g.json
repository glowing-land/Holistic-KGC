  "summary": "We introduce a method to accelerate the evaluation of object detection cascades with the help of a divide-and-conquer procedure in the space of candidate regions . Compared to the exhaustive procedure that thus far is the state-of-the-art for cascade evaluation , the proposed method requires fewer evaluations of the classifier functions , thereby speeding up the search . Furthermore , we show how the recently developed efficient subwindow search -LRB- ESS -RRB- procedure -LSB- 11 -RSB- can be integrated into the last stage of our method . This allows us to use our method to act not only as a faster procedure for cascade evaluation , but also as a tool to perform efficient branch-and-bound object detection with nonlinear quality functions , in particular kernel-ized support vector machines . Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset show an acceleration of more than 50 % by our method compared to standard cascade evaluation .",
