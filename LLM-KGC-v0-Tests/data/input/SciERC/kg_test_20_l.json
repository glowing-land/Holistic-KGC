  "summary": "The problem of blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals is addressed through a method relying on nonstationarity of the original signals . The signals are assumed to be piecewise stationary with varying variances in different epochs . In comparison with previous works , in this paper it is assumed that the signals are not i.i.d. in each epoch , but obey a first-order autoregressive model . This model was shown to be more appropriate for blind separation of natural speech signals . A separation method is proposed that is nearly statistically efficient -LRB- approaching the corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound -RRB- , if the separated signals obey the assumed model . In the case of natural speech signals , the method is shown to have separation accuracy better than the state-of-the-art methods .",
