  "summary": "We propose a novel probabilistic framework for learning visual models of 3D object categories by combining appearance information and geometric constraints . Objects are represented as a coherent ensemble of parts that are consistent under 3D viewpoint transformations . Each part is a collection of salient image features . A generative framework is used for learning a model that captures the relative position of parts within each of the discretized viewpoints . Contrary to most of the existing mixture of viewpoints models , our model establishes explicit correspondences of parts across different viewpoints of the object class . Given a new image , detection and classification are achieved by determining the position and viewpoint of the model that maximize recognition scores of the candidate objects . Our approach is among the first to propose a generative proba-bilistic framework for 3D object categorization . We test our algorithm on the detection task and the viewpoint classification task by using '' car '' category from both the Savarese et al. 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2006 datasets . We show promising results in both the detection and viewpoint classification tasks on these two challenging datasets .",
