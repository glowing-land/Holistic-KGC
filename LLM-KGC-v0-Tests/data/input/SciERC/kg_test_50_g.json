  "summary": "Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices , with applications in signal processing and machine learning . We consider the problem of approximate joint matrix triangularization when the matrices in M are jointly diagonalizable and real , but we only observe a set M ' of noise perturbed versions of the matrices in M . Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M ' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M . The bound depends only on the observable matrices in M ' and the noise level . In particular , it does not depend on optimization specific properties of the triangularizer , such as its proximity to critical points , that are typical of existing bounds in the literature . To our knowledge , this is the first a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition . We demonstrate the bound on synthetic data for which the ground truth is known .",

      "description": "The predicate establishes a quantitative relationship between two concepts: it indicates that the subject offers a theoretical limit or estimate (specifically, a first-order upper bound) on how far apart the approximate and exact joint triangularizers can be in terms of their distance. This implies that the subject serves as a benchmark or reference point for evaluating the accuracy of the approximate joint triangularizer in relation to the exact one.",

      "description": "The predicate establishes a quantitative relationship between the approximate joint triangularizer and the exact joint triangularizer by indicating that the former can estimate the maximum possible deviation from the latter's output. This relationship is contextualized within the framework of approximate joint matrix triangularization, suggesting that the approximate method can be evaluated in terms of its accuracy relative to the exact method.",

      "description": "The predicate 'has a broader term' indicates a hierarchical relationship between the subject and the object, where the subject represents a specific concept or entity that falls under a more general category defined by the object. This relationship suggests that the object encompasses a wider scope or a more inclusive definition that includes the subject as a subset or instance.",
