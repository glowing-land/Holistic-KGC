  "summary": "In this paper , we discuss language model adaptation methods given a word list and a raw corpus . In this situation , the general method is to segment the raw corpus automatically using a word list , correct the output sentences by hand , and build a model from the segmented corpus . In this sentence-by-sentence error correction method , however , the annotator encounters grammatically complicated positions and this results in a decrease of productivity . In this paper , we propose to concentrate on correcting the positions in which the words in the list appear by taking a word as a correction unit . This method allows us to avoid these problems and go directly to capturing the statistical behavior of specific words in the application . In the experiments , we used a variety of methods for preparing a segmented corpus and compared the language models by their speech recognition accuracies . The results showed the advantages of our method .",
