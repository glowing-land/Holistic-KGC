The new criterion -- meaning-entailing substitutability -- fits the needs of semantic-oriented NLP applications and can be evaluated directly -LRB- independent of an application -RRB- at a good level of human agreement . Motivated by this semantic criterion we analyze the empirical quality of distributional word feature vectors and its impact on word similarity results , proposing an objective measure for evaluating feature vector quality . Finally , a novel feature weighting and selection function is presented , which yields superior feature vectors and better word similarity performance .",
