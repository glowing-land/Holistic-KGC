But computational linguists seem to be quite dubious about analogies between sentences : they would not be enough numerous to be of any use . We report experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of analogies among the sentences that it contains . We give two estimates , a lower one and a higher one . As an analogy must be valid on the level of form as well as on the level of meaning , we relied on the idea that translation should preserve meaning to test for similar meanings .",

      "description": "The predicate 'has a broader term' indicates a hierarchical relationship between the subject and the object, where the subject represents a specific instance or category that falls under a more general classification denoted by the object. This relationship implies that the object encompasses a wider range of meanings or instances than the subject, thereby establishing a connection where the subject is a subset of the broader category represented by the object.",
