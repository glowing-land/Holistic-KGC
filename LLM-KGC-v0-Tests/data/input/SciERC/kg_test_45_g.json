  "summary": "Reflections in image sequences consist of several layers superimposed over each other . This phenomenon causes many image processing techniques to fail as they assume the presence of only one layer at each examined site e.g. motion estimation and object recognition . This work presents an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points . It models reflection as regions containing two different layers moving over each other . We present a strong detector based on combining a set of weak detectors . We use novel priors , generate sparse and dense detection maps and our results show high detection rate with rejection to pathological motion and occlusion .",
