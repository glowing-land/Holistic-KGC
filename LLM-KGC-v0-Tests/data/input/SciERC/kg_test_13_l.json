  "summary": "This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an appropriate classifier word for a noun . In Thai language , it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun , both from the point of view of the whole speech community and individual speakers . Basically , there is no exact rule for classifier selection . As far as we can do in the rule-based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun . Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the type of unit classifier because other types are open due to the meaning of representation . We propose a corpus-based method -LRB- Biber ,1993 ; Nagao ,1993 ; Smadja ,1993 -RRB- which generates Noun Classifier Associations -LRB- NCA -RRB- to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase . The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences .",
