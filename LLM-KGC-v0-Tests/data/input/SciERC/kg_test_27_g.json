Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns . We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities . Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision , and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems . We compare our results to state of the art methods such as mi-cro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting .",
