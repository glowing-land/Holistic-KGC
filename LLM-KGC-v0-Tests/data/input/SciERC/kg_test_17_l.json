  "summary": "The robust principal component analysis -LRB- robust PCA -RRB- problem has been considered in many machine learning applications , where the goal is to decompose the data matrix to a low rank part plus a sparse residual . While current approaches are developed by only considering the low rank plus sparse structure , in many applications , side information of row and/or column entities may also be given , and it is still unclear to what extent could such information help robust PCA . Thus , in this paper , we study the problem of robust PCA with side information , where both prior structure and features of entities are exploited for recovery . We propose a convex problem to incorporate side information in robust PCA and show that the low rank matrix can be exactly recovered via the proposed method under certain conditions . In particular , our guarantee suggests that a substantial amount of low rank matrices , which can not be recovered by standard robust PCA , become re-coverable by our proposed method . The result theoretically justifies the effectiveness of features in robust PCA . In addition , we conduct synthetic experiments as well as a real application on noisy image classification to show that our method also improves the performance in practice by exploiting side information .",
