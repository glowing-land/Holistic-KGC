  "summary": "The purpose of this research is to test the efficacy of applying automated evaluation techniques , originally devised for the evaluation of human language learners , to the output of machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- systems . We believe that these evaluation techniques will provide information about both the human language learning process , the translation process and the development of machine translation systems . This , the first experiment in a series of experiments , looks at the intelligibility of MT output . A language learning experiment showed that assessors can differentiate native from non-native language essays in less than 100 words . Even more illuminating was the factors on which the assessors made their decisions . We tested this to see if similar criteria could be elicited from duplicating the experiment using machine translation output . Subjects were given a set of up to six extracts of translated newswire text . Some of the extracts were expert human translations , others were machine translation outputs . The subjects were given three minutes per extract to determine whether they believed the sample output to be an expert human translation or a machine translation . Additionally , they were asked to mark the word at which they made this decision . The results of this experiment , along with a preliminary analysis of the factors involved in the decision making process will be presented here .",
