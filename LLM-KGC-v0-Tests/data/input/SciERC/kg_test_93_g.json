  "summary": "Language resource quality is crucial in NLP . Many of the resources used are derived from data created by human beings out of an NLP context , especially regarding MT and reference translations . Indeed , automatic evaluations need high-quality data that allow the comparison of both automatic and human translations . The validation of these resources is widely recommended before being used . This paper describes the impact of using different-quality references on evaluation . Surprisingly enough , similar scores are obtained in many cases regardless of the quality . Thus , the limitations of the automatic metrics used within MT are also discussed in this regard .",
