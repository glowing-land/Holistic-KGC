  "summary": "Learned confidence measures gain increasing importance for outlier removal and quality improvement in stereo vision . However , acquiring the necessary training data is typically a tedious and time consuming task that involves manual interaction , active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes . To overcome this problem , we propose a new , flexible , and scalable way for generating training data that only requires a set of stereo images as input . The key idea of our approach is to use different view points for reasoning about contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the same stereo algorithm . This enables us to generate a huge amount of training data in a fully automated manner . Among other experiments , we demonstrate the potential of our approach by boosting the performance of three learned confidence measures on the KITTI2012 dataset by simply training them on a vast amount of automatically generated training data rather than a limited amount of laser ground truth data .",
