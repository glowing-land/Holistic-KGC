  "summary": "Given an object model and a black-box measure of similarity between the model and candidate targets , we consider visual object tracking as a numerical optimization problem . During normal tracking conditions when the object is visible from frame to frame , local optimization is used to track the local mode of the similarity measure in a parameter space of translation , rotation and scale . However , when the object becomes partially or totally occluded , such local tracking is prone to failure , especially when common prediction techniques like the Kalman filter do not provide a good estimate of object parameters in future frames . To recover from these inevitable tracking failures , we consider object detection as a global optimization problem and solve it via Adaptive Simulated Annealing -LRB- ASA -RRB- , a method that avoids becoming trapped at local modes and is much faster than exhaustive search . As a Monte Carlo approach , ASA stochastically samples the parameter space , in contrast to local deterministic search . We apply cluster analysis on the sampled parameter space to redetect the object and renew the local tracker . Our numerical hybrid local and global mode-seeking tracker is validated on challenging airborne videos with heavy occlusion and large camera motions . Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on the VIVID benchmark datasets .",
