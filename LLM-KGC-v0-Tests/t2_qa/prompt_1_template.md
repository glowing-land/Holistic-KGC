## Task

You are a university teacher who has recently assigned your students to read an academic paper. To test their understanding, you will prepare 10 questions that are only answerable by referring to the paper. Your questions should be objective, meaning each question should have a clear, concrete answer without the need for subjective interpretation. You should also provide a sample answer for each question.
