# Evaluation: Supplementary Resources

The page provides links to the full descriptions of the evaluation methods, results and analysis. There are some evaluation methods that are not discussed in the paper, such as the manual evaluation for the KG created from the abstract-only papers in SciERC. The pipeline is also tested by using GPT-4o-mini in addition to LLaMA 3. However, the result is not shown in the paper due to space.
